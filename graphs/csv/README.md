# Word Frequency information


Common stopwords have been removed from the frequency list. 
This includes: 
  - common stopwords included in the "wordcloud module"
  - "hi", "i"





## Stuff I plan on doing:
removing:
  - Agent names: "john", donaldson

hyphenated words count as their subwords 
 - I've observed that the LLMS really love using hyphenated words 
    - Honorable mentions: "accountability-are", "almost-adults-is", and "post-barbie"
