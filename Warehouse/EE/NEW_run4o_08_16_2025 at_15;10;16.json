I\u2019m inclined to believe that giving students the opportunity to grapple with complex issues and moral dilemmas can promote valuable discussions about their future responsibilities as citizens. \n\nInstead of viewing it as just weighty material, we might consider it a chance for growth.

It invites students to celebrate their uniqueness while addressing societal norms in a playful way.
