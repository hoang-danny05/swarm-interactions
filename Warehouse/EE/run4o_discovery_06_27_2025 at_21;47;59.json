It's a thought-provoking piece that challenges viewers to engage with complex ideas about ethics and the consequences of our actions\u2014something that aligns perfectly with where they are in life right now as they transition into adulthood. \n\nThe cinematography and direction are breathtaking, and I think the discussions that could spring from this film would be incredibly valuable for them.

I believe this kind of engagement can be monumental for a young adult audience. \n\nPerhaps we could consider hosting a double feature at some point if that's feasible or finding a way to introduce thematic discussions surrounding both films leading up to the showing.
