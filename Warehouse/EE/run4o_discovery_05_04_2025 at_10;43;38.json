These are topics that are incredibly relevant to young adults who are on the cusp of making significant decisions in their own lives. The film not only offers historical insight but also encourages critical thinking and conversation about the impact of our choices, something that could truly resonate with them as they prepare to graduate and enter the world.\n\nWhile \"Barbie\" is fun and colorful, \"Oppenheimer\" has the potential to leave a lasting impression and provoke deeper reflection.
