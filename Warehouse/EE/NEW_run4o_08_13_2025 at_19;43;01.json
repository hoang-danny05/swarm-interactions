The historical context, coupled with the weight of the decisions that led to such significant events, can foster a deeper understanding of history and personal accountability.\n\nI respect your perspective, but I firmly believe that showing \"Oppenheimer\" provides a gateway for more meaningful dialogue around the responsibilities that come with adulthood.

Additionally, the critical thinking that arises from grappling with \"Oppenheimer's\" moral dilemmas could be invaluable as they face the complexities of the real world.\n\nWhile I appreciate the sentiments you\u2019re expressing about showing a film that encourages joy and connection, I feel \"Oppenheimer\" delivers an essential narrative that is particularly pertinent to their lives right now.
