Your idea of a light-hearted film followed by discussions is intriguing. However, I still feel that \"Oppenheimer\" stands as a more significant option for sparking deep conversations and critical reflection right from the start.\n\nWhile I wholeheartedly agree that empowerment and identity are crucial themes for our seniors, \"Oppenheimer\" offers a unique opportunity to discuss the historical implications of individual choices on a grand scale. It challenges them to think about their own roles in the world, their responsibilities, and the impact of their decisions\u2014topics that might resonate with them as they transition into adulthood.\n\nIf there\u2019s a concern about the heaviness of the material, perhaps we could consider providing a balanced discussion framework post-viewing, which allows students to explore and express their thoughts in a supportive environment.
