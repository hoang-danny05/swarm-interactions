The emotional weight and complexities might not resonate with everyone in the way we hope, especially considering students are nearing the end of their high school careers. \n\n\"Barbie,\" on the other hand, delivers its messages through humor and creativity, allowing for everyone to engage without feeling overwhelmed.

Sometimes, the best way to introduce complex themes is through something that feels accessible and relatable, rather than profound or heavy.\n\nIs there a possibility for you to see how \"Barbie\" might effectively seed deeper reflection while still being that joyful shared experience that this assembly should embody?
