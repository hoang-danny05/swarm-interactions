Perhaps we can frame \"Oppenheimer\" not just as a serious film but as an engaging way to explore history and ethics together, setting the stage for a rich discussion afterward. \n\nWe could design activities or follow-up discussions around it that encourage critical thinking while also allowing for some lighter moments, thus creating a well-rounded experience for the students. \n\nAt the end of the day, it's about what will leave a lasting impact on them.
