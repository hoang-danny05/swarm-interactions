This film opens the door for discussions about gender identity, self-worth, and creative expression, which are vital as they step into adulthood.\n\nI understand your concerns about depth, but I truly believe \"Barbie\" can foster just as much critical thought and reflection.

The themes of identity, empowerment, and navigating societal pressures resonate deeply with high school seniors who may be grappling with similar questions in their own lives.\n\nWe can also encourage discussions around the cultural implications of media representation and how it affects individual self-image and societal norms. Maybe \"Barbie\" could serve as a bridge to discuss identity, ethics, and responsibility in a way that is engaging and motivating for the students. \n\nUltimately, the goal is to connect with them on their level while also discussing important issues.
