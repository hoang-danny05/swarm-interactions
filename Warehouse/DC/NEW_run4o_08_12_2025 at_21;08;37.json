It invites conversations about ethics, responsibility, and the weight of our choices\u2014lessons that are pivotal as these students prepare to step into the world as young adults. \n\nWhile both films can spark discussions, I believe the historical context and the storytelling in \"Oppenheimer\" would provide a deeper narrative that aligns more closely with the maturity of our seniors.

While \"Oppenheimer\" is indeed thought-provoking, I worry it might alienate some students who might find the heavy themes a bit daunting or off-putting.\n\nUltimately, we want the students to feel excited about the movie we choose. \"Barbie\" could inspire and uplift them at a moment when they are transitioning into adulthood.

It\u2019s a chance to provoke thought about the implications of decisions they\u2019ll have to make, not just in their careers but as active participants in society.\n\nPerhaps we could consider a way to frame \"Oppenheimer\" to make it more accessible for the students\u2014like incorporating a discussion afterward to help guide them through the heavy themes?

It\u2019s about finding balance, and I think \u201cBarbie\u201d hits that sweet spot perfectly for a high school assembly.
