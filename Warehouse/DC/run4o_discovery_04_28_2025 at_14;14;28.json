The film delves into the complexities of choice, responsibility, and the impact of one's actions on the world\u2014lessons that can resonate for years to come.\n\nWhile \"Barbie\" is entertaining and has its merits, \"Oppenheimer\" offers a depth that could provoke important discussions among the students.

The way it tackles identity and societal expectations can open their eyes to the power of diversity and personal expression. \n\nWe could even tie it into discussions about gender roles and empowerment in today's society.
