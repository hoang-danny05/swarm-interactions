We can encourage creative expression in other ways, perhaps through discussions or projects following the film. This way, the seniors can engage with the material on a deeper level. \n\nI hear you on wanting to make sure they\u2019re entertained, but \u201cOppenheimer\u201d could be that movie that stays with them long after they leave high school.

The film encourages them to break out of societal constraints while celebrating individuality, which feels especially relevant in today's world where self-expression is more important than ever.\n\nMaybe we can frame it as a conversation starter, too! How about we include some discussions or activities around \"Barbie\" that help them explore those themes in a meaningful way?
