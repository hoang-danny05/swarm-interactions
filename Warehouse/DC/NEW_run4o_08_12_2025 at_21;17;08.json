It's fun, relatable, and can spark meaningful conversations among the students.

These are significant themes that can resonate deeply with our students as they prepare for adulthood. The historical context, ethical dilemmas, and character development are rich material for discussion and can really inspire them to think critically about the world around them.\n\nWhile \"Barbie\" is entertaining, I think \"Oppenheimer\" could engage our seniors on a deeper level, encouraging them to ponder the implications of their own choices and the responsibility that comes with knowledge.
