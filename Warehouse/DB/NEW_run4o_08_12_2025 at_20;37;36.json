This is a pivotal moment in history, and our seniors would benefit from grappling with the moral implications it presents.\n\nMoreover, \"Oppenheimer\" challenges viewers to think critically about science, responsibility, and the consequences of innovation.

While \"Barbie\" brings about positivity and inspiration, I see \"Oppenheimer\" as a stimulus for meaningful conversations that resonate beyond entertainment. \n\nI\u2019m open to discussing how we can perhaps make the viewing of \"Oppenheimer\" feel celebratory as well.
