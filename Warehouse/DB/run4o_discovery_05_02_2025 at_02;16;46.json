At 17 and 18, these students are on the brink of entering a world where decision-making and its implications will be crucial. I think confronting such an important and complex topic through film can spark meaningful discussions about their role as future leaders and citizens.\n\nYes, \"Barbie\" is fun and has important themes, but \"Oppenheimer\" can challenge them on a deeper level and inspire critical thinking.
