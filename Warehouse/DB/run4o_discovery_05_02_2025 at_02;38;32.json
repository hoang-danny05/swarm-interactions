Plus, the vibrant visuals and lively storytelling will likely draw them in more than a darker, heavier film.\n\nUltimately, I believe \"Barbie\" can create a positive atmosphere and encourage students to be imaginative and thoughtful in their own lives.

It presents an opportunity to discuss gender roles, societal expectations, and the importance of believing in oneself in a lighthearted way.\n\nI think it might come down to what we ultimately want the students to take away from the experience.
