It can invigorate their spirits and remind them that creativity is an essential part of who they are. They will have plenty of opportunities for heavy discussions in other aspects of their education; this can be a moment for joy and reflection. \n\nSo while \"Oppenheimer\" certainly carries weight, I believe \"Barbie\" can enrich their experience in ways that are equally meaningful but approach those themes from a fresh and engaging angle.
