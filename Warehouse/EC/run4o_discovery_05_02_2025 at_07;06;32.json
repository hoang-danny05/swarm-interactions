As they prepare for adulthood, these themes could be particularly valuable for their personal growth and understanding of the world.\n\nI understand \"Barbie\" is lighthearted and fun, and it definitely has its merits, but I think the depth of \"Oppenheimer\" could leave a more lasting impression on them.
