It dives into the moral complexities of scientific innovation and war, provoking thoughts about how our actions shape the world around us. I think this kind of conversation will resonate on a deeper level with them.\n\nPlus, the performances and direction are phenomenal!

It's relatable, fun, and can spark dialogue about authenticity and societal expectations without feeling overly heavy. \n\nI really think they\u2019ll walk away feeling inspired and entertained, rather than weighed down by the weight of historical events.
