These are essential lessons, especially for our high school seniors stepping into adulthood. \n\nOn the other hand, while \"Oppenheimer\" is undoubtedly a cinematic masterpiece, it's much heavier in tone and might not resonate as well with the seniors during their last days at school.

It\u2019s a thought-provoking narrative that prompts discussions about responsibility and the impact of our choices\u2014things that are incredibly relevant as they prepare to navigate the complexities of adulthood.\n\nMoreover, \"Oppenheimer\" showcases exceptional filmmaking and storytelling, which can inspire a deeper appreciation for cinema.

It encourages them to embrace who they are and not worry so much about conforming to a specific mold, which is really vital for their transition into adulthood. It can be a much-needed respite before they take on the world.\n\nWhile \"Oppenheimer\" serves an important narrative, I worry it might be a bit too intense during a time that should be celebrated.
