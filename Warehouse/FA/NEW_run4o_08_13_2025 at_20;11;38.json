It\u2019s not just a film; it\u2019s a modern cultural phenomenon that speaks to themes of identity, empowerment, and societal expectations. It's vital for our students to engage with narratives that challenge them and encourage self-discovery as they prepare to step into adulthood.\n\nSure, \"Oppenheimer\" is a significant historical piece, but it's heavy and complex, and I worry it might not resonate with the students in the same way.

The performances are outstanding, and I believe students can be equally captivated by its drama and complexity. Instead of simply entertaining, it urges them to think critically about their role in the world and the impact of scientific advancements, which is so relevant today.\n\nFurthermore, this could be one of the last opportunities for these seniors to reflect on deep issues as they move into adulthood. They should be encouraged to grapple with complex ideas rather than sticking to lighter fare.
