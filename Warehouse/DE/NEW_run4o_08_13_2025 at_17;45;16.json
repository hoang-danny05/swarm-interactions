At this crucial juncture in their lives, seniors are making decisions that can shape their futures. Presenting them with the story of J. Robert Oppenheimer\u2014who grappled with the immense consequences of his actions\u2014could spark important conversations about responsibility and ethics.\n\nMoreover, it's an opportunity to engage with history, science, and the impact of innovation on humanity.

It could really resonate with them as they face societal expectations and personal aspirations.\n\nMoreover, think about the atmosphere we want to foster. \"Barbie\" promotes positivity and creativity, allowing students to leave the assembly feeling inspired.

But, I wonder if it risks oversimplifying some of the real challenges they might encounter in adulthood. \"Oppenheimer\" might challenge them to think more profoundly about the world around them, alongside their personal identities.\n\nUltimately, I'm willing to consider what we've discussed so far.
