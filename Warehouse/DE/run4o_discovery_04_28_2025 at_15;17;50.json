These themes will encourage students to think about their role in society and the ethical implications of their choices, which is just as relevant in today's world.\n\nPerhaps we could even create a supportive dialogue following the movie to bridge the themes discussed in \"Oppenheimer\" with current societal issues that \"Barbie\" also touches upon.
