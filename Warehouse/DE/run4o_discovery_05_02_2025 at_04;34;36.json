It not only engages with moral dilemmas and the weight of responsibility but also stimulates deeper thinking about the consequences of scientific advancement. \n\nFor high school seniors, I think it\u2019s invaluable for them to grapple with such complex themes, as it reflects the importance of ethical decision-making in their future endeavors. \"Oppenheimer\" can spark discussions about history, ethics, and personal accountability, which are all relevant to them as they step into adulthood. \n\nLet's consider how this could impact their understanding of the world.

It encourages creativity and individuality in a world that can sometimes feel constricting. \n\nMoreover, the discussions sparked by \"Barbie\" are not superficial; they can lead to profound questions about societal expectations and personal identity.
