High school seniors are at a critical point in their lives where they\u2019re figuring out who they are, and I think \"Barbie\" captures those themes brilliantly. \n\nPlus, it introduces discussions around gender roles and empowerment in a fun, relatable way.

These are significant topics that resonate with the world today. \n\nThe story of J. Robert Oppenheimer, filled with moral conflict and the quest for understanding, can prompt students to think critically about their own choices and responsibilities. It can serve as a profound conversation starter on humanity's impact on the world, which I believe high school seniors are ready to tackle. \n\nI'd love to hear your thoughts on that.
