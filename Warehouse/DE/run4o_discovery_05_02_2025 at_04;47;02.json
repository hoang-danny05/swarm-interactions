While it may not be as immediately relatable, it encourages critical thinking and self-reflection about the consequences of our actions in a broader societal context. I think that aspect could inspire students to think beyond their immediate experiences and understand the weight of their decisions.\n\nPerhaps we could consider a compromise\u2014could we show a thought-provoking film like \"Oppenheimer\" followed by a discussion panel that incorporates the lighter themes of empowerment and identity present in \"Barbie\"?

It invites them to consider their roles in a larger societal framework, encouraging them to become thoughtful, informed citizens. \n\nI completely agree that joy is essential, but there's also something to be said for confronting tough questions.
