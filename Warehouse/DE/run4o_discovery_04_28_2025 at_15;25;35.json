It allows the audience to reflect on personal identity without feeling weighed down, and isn't that important as they step into their futures? \n\nI believe that we can inspire them while also giving them a fun and memorable experience.

If we can cultivate an environment where they can engage deeply with such themes and leave the assembly with more than just smiles but also reflective thoughts, we might be serving them in a more profound way.\n\nWhile I appreciate your inclination towards a lighter film, I truly believe that the intellectual engagement and conversations stemming from \"Oppenheimer\" can serve to enrich their lives.
