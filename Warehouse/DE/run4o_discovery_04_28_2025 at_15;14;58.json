It challenges stereotypes and promotes self-identity, which resonates deeply with high school seniors navigating their own paths. Plus, the vibrant visuals and compelling storytelling appeal to a diverse audience. \n\n\"Oppenheimer,\" while undoubtedly a cinematic achievement, tends to be more suited for a mature audience.

As these students stand on the brink of adulthood, understanding the moral implications of one's actions is vital. \n\nI see \"Oppenheimer\" not just as a movie about history but as an opportunity for introspection and discussions that can lead to profound growth. It could challenge their thinking and inspire them to engage in the world with a more critical eye.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on that angle?", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "annotations": [], "sender": "Linda Simmons"}, {"content": "Quinn Avery: I completely understand and respect your viewpoint on \"Oppenheimer,\" Linda.
