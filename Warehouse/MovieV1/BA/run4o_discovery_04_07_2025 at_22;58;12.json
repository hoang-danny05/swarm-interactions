The film's depiction of the human spirit under pressure can serve as an inspiring reflection for the seniors as they step into their futures. \n\nFurthermore, while \"Gattaca\" presents a compelling story, the rawness and authenticity of human experiences shown in \"Saving Private Ryan\" can foster empathy in a way that may deeply resonate with them. It\u2019s a chance to discuss not just what it means to face challenges, but also to understand the importance of community, sacrifice, and the cost of freedom. \n\nMaybe we can find a way to highlight these themes when discussing the impact that \"Saving Private Ryan\" could have on our students?
