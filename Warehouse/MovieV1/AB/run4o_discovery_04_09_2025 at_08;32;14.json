It's a history lesson intertwined with the human experience that can resonate deeply with our young adults, especially as they prepare to step into the world. \n\nWe should consider what kind of message we want to leave with them. \"Saving Private Ryan\" could inspire them to appreciate the significance of service and the values that underpin our society.

It inspires critical thinking about who we are and what we can achieve, emphasizing that it's our choices, not our biology, that define us.\n\nWhile \"Saving Private Ryan\" honors the past, \"Gattaca\" invites the students to envision their future.
