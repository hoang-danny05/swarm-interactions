These themes resonate deeply in today's world, where they might face pressures to conform or follow predetermined paths based on societal expectations or even their own backgrounds.\n\nWith the aid of a companion discussion alongside \"Saving Private Ryan,\" we could foster a more holistic view of both duty to society and individual aspirations.

By discussing both, students can see how individuals contribute to a greater cause while also striving to find their own paths in life.\n\nFor instance, we could highlight how the character development in \"Saving Private Ryan,\" especially in moments of camaraderie, shows that achieving our dreams is not just a solitary endeavor; it often requires teamwork, support, and sometimes, sacrifices from others. This reinforces the idea that their ambitions should be pursued with an awareness of the broader community they are a part of.\n\nBy integrating these themes in our discussions, we can help students recognize the opportunity presented by their freedoms, which were earned through sacrifices of the past.
