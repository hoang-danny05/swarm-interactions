It\u2019s a stark reminder of the consequences of conflict and the importance of valuing freedom, which I think is crucial for our seniors as they prepare to embark on their next journeys.

In many ways, these challenges they will encounter in emerging fields could be as daunting as those portrayed in the struggles of war.\n\nMy concern is that if we focus solely on the past\u2019s sacrifices without addressing the complexities they\u2019ll face in the future, we miss an opportunity to prepare them for the world that awaits.
