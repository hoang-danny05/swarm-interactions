It champions themes of self-discovery, empowerment, and challenges traditional societal norms \u2014 important messages for our future leaders.\n\nFurthermore, it's colorful, fun, and meticulously crafted, making it a visual delight that can spark conversation about identity and change.

However, I really believe \"Oppenheimer\" is the stronger choice for the seniors. \n\nFirstly, it's a powerful exploration of ethics in science and the moral complexities of inventions, especially nuclear weapons, that shape our world today. This movie provides an opportunity for discussion on responsibility, consequences, and the impact of one's choices, all crucial topics for high school seniors as they prepare to step into adulthood.\n\nMoreover, the film features some of the best performances and direction I've seen in recent years. It's a cinematic experience that immerses viewers in history and prompts real thought about our past and future.

It's crucial for them to see that creativity and individuality are celebrated. While \"Oppenheimer\" is certainly impactful, it risks alienating some students who may not connect with its heavy themes right now. \n\nWe want to create an environment where every student feels seen, understood, and inspired.
