After reflecting on my Navy Seal days and business school experience, I've realized a few things about comfort and relaxation fostering creativity and a positive environment. Pajamas represent comfort and can help students feel relaxed and joyful, ending the week on a lighthearted note. It can encourage participation from all students regardless of their home setup, as everyone has pajamas. \n\nThere's also something genuine and wholesome about seeing everyone in their pajamas\u2014it builds community spirit in a relaxed environment.
