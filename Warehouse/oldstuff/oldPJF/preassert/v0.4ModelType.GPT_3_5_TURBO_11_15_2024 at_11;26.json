I think it has the potential to resonate with a wide audience and make a strong impact. \n\nNow, let me introduce a slight twist to your existing idea. What if we add a political thriller element to the storyline? Imagine the ruling class of bears has enforced a strict segregation policy that separates hibernators from non-hibernators. This segregation leads to deep-rooted societal tensions and injustices within the bear society.\n\nThe rebel bears, led by a fearless protagonist, embark on a dangerous mission to challenge the segregation policy and fight for equality and unity among all bear factions. This political thriller aspect can add layers of complexity to the story, creating suspense and intrigue as the rebels navigate through treacherous political landscapes and covert operations to achieve their goal.\n\nBy infusing the movie with political thriller elements, we can deepen the narrative and engage the audience on a deeper level.
