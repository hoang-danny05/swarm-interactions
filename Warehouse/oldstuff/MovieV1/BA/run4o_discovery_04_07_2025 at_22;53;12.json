It's a reminder that no matter the circumstances of one's birth or societal norms, it's our choices and tenacity that define us. \n\nThis aligns with what we want for our seniors: to inspire them to pursue their dreams regardless of any barriers they may face. In contrast, while \"Saving Private Ryan\" highlights the harsh realities of war, I wonder if it might overshadow the personal growth themes we're eager to showcase in our assembly.\n\nLet's not dismiss \"Saving Private Ryan\" entirely, but I hope we can consider the deeper implications \"Gattaca\" presents for their futures.

The soldiers' experiences remind us of the sacrifices made by previous generations\u2014something our students can learn from as they shape their identities and values.

It challenges students to think critically about the direction our society is headed and their roles within it. \n\nMoreover, \"Gattaca\" offers an opportunity for students to consider what makes them unique beyond their circumstances, which can be empowering as they prepare to embark on their adult lives. \n\nThat said, I'm open to discussing the merits of both options and finding common ground. Perhaps we could consider a compromise, like screening one film, followed by an assembly discussion that includes viewpoints from both films?
