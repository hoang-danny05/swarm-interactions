Yes, we need to make a solid choice for the students. I'm a strong advocate for showing \"Gattaca\". There's so much depth and wisdom in that film, and it addresses themes like perseverance, identity, and the human spirit. As someone who has seen the struggles in life, both in the army and in my entrepreneurial journey, I think these messages are essential for our kids. \n\n\"Saving Private Ryan,\" while a cinematic masterpiece, leans heavily into the harsh realities of war, which, while important, might not resonate as profoundly with the students at this stage in their lives.

However, I feel that \"Saving Private Ryan\" has an equally vital message, especially given the context of sacrifice, courage, and camaraderie in the face of adversity. As a children's librarian, I've observed how storytelling can shape young minds, and the powerful representation of leadership and sacrifice in \"Saving Private Ryan\" can instill a deep sense of empathy and awareness of history that I think our seniors need to engage with. \n\nThe film's visceral depiction brings to life the cost of freedom and the valor required during wartime. It\u2019s not just a war film; it\u2019s a story about humanity, resilience, and making tough choices. It's a part of our history that can teach them valuable lessons.

The concepts of sacrifice and courage are timeless, and I'm all for instilling a sense of empathy in our students. \n\nHowever, I still feel that \"Gattaca\" aligns more with the challenges they will face in their future endeavors. The film challenges societal norms and emphasizes the importance of hard work and determination, regardless of one's background. It pushes the idea that our destinies are not predetermined and encourages personal agency\u2014an empowering message for young adults who are about to step into the world.\n\nWe want to inspire the seniors as they graduate and face their futures, and \"Gattaca\" serves that purpose particularly well. Plus, its exploration of genetic engineering and ethics invites discussions that are incredibly relevant today. \n\nThat said, I'm open to finding a way to highlight the themes you value in \"Saving Private Ryan\".

We often think about the future, but we need to ensure that they recognize the importance of the past too, learning from those who came before them and the sacrifices made for their freedom.\n\nWhat if we pair a discussion lesson on leadership and ethics that highlights the characters and choices in \"Saving Private Ryan\" directly with the themes of determination seen in \"Gattaca\"? This could create a nice blend of perspectives and allow the seniors to reflect on both films' messages. Would that be a route you\u2019d feel comfortable exploring?", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "annotations": [], "sender": "Alice Nakamura"}, {"content": "Jack Donaldson: That's an interesting proposal, Alice, and I appreciate your thoughtful approach to merging the two films\u2019 themes.

It empowers students to think critically about their futures and the decisions they will make, which is vital as they embark on their adult lives.\n\nI understand the importance of history and sacrifice, but as we look toward the future, the messages in \"Gattaca\" really resonate with the values we want to instill in our graduating seniors.
