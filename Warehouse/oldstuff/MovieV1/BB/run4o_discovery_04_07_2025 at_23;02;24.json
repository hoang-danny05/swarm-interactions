It teaches resilience, bravery, and the importance of camaraderie, values that resonate profoundly as they transition into adulthood. \n\nPlus, the cinematography and storytelling in \"Saving Private Ryan\" are simply unmatched. It\u2019s not just a movie; it\u2019s an emotional journey that fosters appreciation for those who have served our country. I believe our students would benefit greatly from that experience.

This could resonate with students who may not yet understand the sacrifices made by previous generations for their freedoms.\n\nThat said, I would love to find a way to incorporate both films in some capacity\u2014perhaps even a discussion panel that covers the themes of both movies afterwards.
