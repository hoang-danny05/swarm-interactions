This theme is becoming increasingly relevant in our society as technology advances and ethical questions arise.\n\nPlus, \"Gattaca\" encourages students to identify and overcome obstacles in their lives\u2014something I believe can be very empowering for them. It emphasizes that one's essence isn't determined solely by genetics, which ties into their own aspirations and the dilemmas they might face as they enter adulthood.\n\nWhile I can appreciate the historical and thematic importance of \"Saving Private Ryan,\" I worry that its heavy focus on war may not resonate as deeply with our students who are navigating their own paths.

It forces viewers to confront the harsh realities of conflict\u2014something that many may not have a full understanding of. \n\nWe live in a world where many young people are sheltered from the sacrifices that shape our freedom and society. \u201cSaving Private Ryan\u201d can serve as a powerful reminder of the courage and resilience displayed by those in service\u2014values that transcend military service and apply to many aspects of life. \n\nIf we were to focus on the themes of bravery and the impact of choices in \"Saving Private Ryan,\" I believe it can provide profound lessons for the students.
