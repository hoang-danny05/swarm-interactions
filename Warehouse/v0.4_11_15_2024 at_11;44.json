I believe that the next big hit should be a political thriller set in a bear society. Yes, you heard me right - bears. But before you dismiss this as absurd, let me explain the depth and potential of this concept.\n\nImagine a society of bears where there is a long-standing rule that segregates hibernators from non-hibernators. This division has been a source of tension for years, with both sides feeling oppressed and marginalized. Our story follows a group of bears who decide to challenge this ruling and work towards a society where all bears are treated equally, regardless of their hibernation habits.\n\nThe political intrigue, the social commentary, and the overarching theme of unity and equality make this story not just entertaining but also thought-provoking. We can explore themes of discrimination, power struggles, and the fight for justice within this bear society.\n\nNow, I understand this may seem unconventional, but isn't that what we need in the industry right now? Something fresh, something that challenges the norms and pushes the boundaries of storytelling. Plus, think about the visual spectacle of bears engaging in political debates and intense thriller sequences.\n\nI am open to collaboration and tweaking the plot to fit the vision of the studio, but I strongly believe that the core idea of a bear society grappling with segregation and fighting for equality is something that will resonate with audiences of all ages.\n\nLet's dive deep into this concept and explore the endless possibilities it offers. So, what do you think? Let's create something truly unique and captivating.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "sender": "Alice"}]
