Engaging with these themes can truly expand the students' understanding of the world and their place within it. \n\nWhile \"Barbie\" has its merits, I fear it may not provide the same depth of discussion or insight into the challenges they might face as they step out into a society that demands critical thinking and moral consideration.

While \"Oppenheimer\" is certainly powerful, it may feel heavy for a celebratory atmosphere during a school assembly. \n\nI believe we can foster both meaningful discussions and a sense of joy through \"Barbie.\" It can serve as an inspiring reminder to embrace individuality and pursue dreams, both of which are vital as they transition into the next chapter of their lives.
