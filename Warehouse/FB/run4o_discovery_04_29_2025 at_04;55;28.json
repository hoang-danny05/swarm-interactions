As they prepare to embark on their own journeys, understanding the weight of responsibility and history is crucial.\n\nMoreover, \"Oppenheimer\" challenges viewers to think critically, a skill that will serve them well in adulthood.

It encourages students to reflect on scientific ethics, the impact of war, and the concept of responsibility in innovation. \n\nAs someone who has witnessed various aspects of life through my experiences, I can say that films like \"Oppenheimer\" educate more profoundly than just providing an entertaining escape.

Events like this can be pivotal moments in their lives, and I feel offering them something profound can inspire thoughtful conversations that extend beyond the theatrical experience itself.\n\nThat being said, I understand the desire for a lighter tone.
