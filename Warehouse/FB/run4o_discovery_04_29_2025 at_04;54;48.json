The pastel color palettes and delightful world it creates draw audiences in and spark creativity.\n\nWith everything our seniors have been through academically, I think they deserve something fun and thought-provoking. \"Oppenheimer,\" while certainly a cinematic achievement, may not resonate with the spirit and joy we want to celebrate at this stage in their lives. \n\nWhat are your thoughts?", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "annotations": [], "sender": "Amy Nakamura"}, {"content": "Ellis Whitmore: I appreciate your perspective, Amy, but I truly believe that \"Oppenheimer\" would be the more impactful choice for our seniors.
