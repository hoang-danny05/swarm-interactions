The themes of breaking societal norms can empower them in their personal journeys as they transition from high school. Plus, there's a delightful element of fun\u2014something I think seniors might be drawn to as a way to unwind.\n\nWhile both films have merit, I think \"Barbie\" promotes a sense of joy and inspiration that could lift their spirits at this pivotal moment in their lives.

It encourages them to express themselves, which is pivotal in these formative years.\n\nWhat if we consider different ways to highlight the themes of responsibility and ethics in our school's curriculum outside of the assembly?

If we could schedule a follow-up event focused on the themes you\u2019ve mentioned from \"Oppenheimer,\" I think it could provide a great balance. \n\nSo, I\u2019d like to stand firm on \"Barbie\" as the main feature, allowing room for additional discussions afterward.
