It not only offers a historical perspective but also encourages critical thinking about the ethical implications of science and technology. \n\nGiven that these students are entering a rapidly changing world, I believe it's essential to engage them with thought-provoking content. \"Oppenheimer\" could inspire discussions that transcend the screen and help them contemplate the implications of their own actions as future leaders.\n\nI respect your viewpoint, but I think \"Oppenheimer\" is the clear choice for helping them navigate their futures.
