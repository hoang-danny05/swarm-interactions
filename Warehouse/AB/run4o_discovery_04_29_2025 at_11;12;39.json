It showcases real historical events and encourages critical thinking, which I think could spark meaningful conversations amongst the students.\n\nMoreover, the film urges the audience to reflect on the ethical implications of technology and innovation, important topics as they navigate their future paths.

It encourages them to embrace who they are and challenge societal norms, all while engaging them with humor and creativity. \n\nI see your point about moral responsibility and history, but \"Barbie\" can offer wisdom in a way that is accessible and relatable.
