The historical significance of J. Robert Oppenheimer's story offers them a chance to reflect on the ethical implications of scientific advancements as well, a lesson that remains relevant today.\n\nIt's not just about entertainment; it's about educating and provoking thought.

Its themes of acceptance and positivity might resonate deeply during such a pivotal time in their lives.\n\nAdditionally, \"Barbie\" has the potential to bring students together in a fun way, fostering camaraderie and light-heartedness.
