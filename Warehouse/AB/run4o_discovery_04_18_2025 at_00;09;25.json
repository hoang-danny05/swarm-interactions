It's about choices, consequences, and the heavy burden of innovation. \n\nFor young minds on the cusp of adulthood, it sparks critical thinking about ethics, leadership, and the turbulent history of nuclear weapons\u2014a pivotal moment in our history that continues to influence global relations today. \n\nWhile both films have value, I believe \"Oppenheimer\" encourages a deeper level of introspection that can truly resonate with them.
