Yes, it's an important decision.

It's not just a film; it's an experience that encourages empathy and understanding of the sacrifices made for freedom. \n\nI fear that \"Gattaca,\" while intellectually stimulating, might not resonate with them on a deeply emotional level as \"Saving Private Ryan\" would.

The ethical dilemmas presented in \"Gattaca\" can lead to rich discussions about choice, identity, and what makes someone \"successful.\" In a world that is increasingly influenced by technology, these are critical conversations for our youth.\n\nI'd like to suggest a compromise: perhaps we could plan a series of discussions around both films?

In today's rapidly evolving world, our students will encounter issues related to technology, ethics, and personal identity\u2014conversations initiated by \"Gattaca\" can equip them with critical thinking skills for the future.\n\nStill, I want to find common ground. If we were to show \"Saving Private Ryan,\" how about we preface it with an assembly discussing the importance of understanding history and its impact on our choices, and then have post-viewing discussions echoing the themes from \"Gattaca\"?
