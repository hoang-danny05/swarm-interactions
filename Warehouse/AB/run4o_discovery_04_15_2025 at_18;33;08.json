Plus, the colorful visuals and humor can engage them in a way that\u2019s both entertaining and meaningful.\n\nI think it\u2019s a great opportunity for dialogue afterward, and it resonates well with the diverse experiences our students may have had.

Showing \"Oppenheimer\" could spark meaningful conversations among students about critical thinking, the balance of innovation and ethics, and the path our society has taken. Plus, it might inspire them to think about the kind of impact they want to leave in their own careers. \n\nIn my experience, films that challenge us to think deeply often resonate and stick with us in ways that lighter films do not.
