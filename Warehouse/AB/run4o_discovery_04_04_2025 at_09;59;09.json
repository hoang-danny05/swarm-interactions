It presents a raw, authentic view of humanity during conflict. The bravery of those soldiers, and the moral complexities they faced, could provide an invaluable lesson about courage, sacrifice, and working together for a greater cause.\n\nMoreover, its cinematography and storytelling are powerful. It creates a connection to history that can spark critical discussions around duty, honor, and the human cost of war.

It's a story about perseverance\u2014a relatable theme as they prepare to step into the world after graduation. \n\nI think it'd be beneficial for them to engage with a story that challenges existing norms on identity and what it means to be 'successful.'
