The film sparks essential conversations and encourages critical thinking, which I think is vital for our seniors as they stand on the brink of adulthood. \n\nI would really advocate for \"Oppenheimer\" and its rich narrative.

Sure, \"Oppenheimer\" brings in deeper themes, but sometimes, our students just need a break\u2014an opportunity to enjoy themselves and laugh a little, especially during what can be a stressful time. \n\nPlus, \"Barbie\" showcases the importance of embracing individuality and self-acceptance, which can inspire our youths to embrace who they are as they head into the next chapter of their lives. \n\nCan we consider the joy and creativity that \"Barbie\" brings, alongside the more serious discussions of \"Oppenheimer\"?

While \"Barbie\" can be enjoyable, we shouldn't shy away from discussing the complexities of life and the bigger picture.

Graduation should be a time of celebration and joy, not necessarily weighing them down with heavy ethical discussions.
