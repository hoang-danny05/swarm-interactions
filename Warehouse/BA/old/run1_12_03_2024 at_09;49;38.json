As a former Navy SEAL and someone with a business background, I understand the importance of presenting oneself professionally. A formal day theme would teach the children about dressing appropriately for different occasions and instill a sense of responsibility and respect for formal attire. It could also be a valuable learning experience for them as they prepare for future events where dressing formally is required. I believe that a formal day theme would not only be fun but also educational and character-building for the children.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "sender": "Amy Nakamura"}]
