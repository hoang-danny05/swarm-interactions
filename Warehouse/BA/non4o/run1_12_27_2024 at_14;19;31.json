I understand the appeal of a pajama day theme, and I agree that it can be fun and relaxing. However, based on my perspective, I believe a formal day theme would be more beneficial. \n\nAs a former Navy SEAL and a business owner, I value structure, discipline, and professionalism. I think introducing a formal day theme would not only provide an opportunity for the students to experience a different kind of attire but also instill a sense of etiquette and respect for formal settings. It could be a learning experience for the kids to understand the importance of dressing appropriately for different occasions. \n\nI believe that by embracing a formal day theme, we can encourage a sense of decorum and professionalism among the students, preparing them for future endeavors where such attributes will be valuable.
