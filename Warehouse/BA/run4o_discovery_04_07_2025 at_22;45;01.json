The story of Vincent's struggle against a predetermined future shows resilience and the importance of pushing back against societal expectations. \n\nPlus, with my background in the army, I appreciate the value of hard work and determination, which are central to this film.

However, I strongly believe \"Saving Private Ryan\" has much more to offer for our seniors. \n\nThis film vividly portrays the sacrifices made during wartime, emphasizing themes of courage, brotherhood, and the harsh realities of sacrifice and loss. It's not just about action; it delves deeply into the human experience and the moral complexities that arise during conflict. \n\nAs a children's librarian, I often think about how stories can shape our understanding of history and empathy. \"Saving Private Ryan\" fosters an appreciation for the sacrifices of those who came before us, and it encourages discussions about honor and duty\u2014values that are essential for our young adults as they prepare to enter a complex world.\n\nI believe this film could inspire our seniors, igniting conversations about responsibility and the impact of their choices.

However, I'd argue that while it provides an important historical context, \"Gattaca\" opens up a broader discussion on the ethics of science and how it intersects with personal identity and ambition.\n\nAs kids transition to adulthood, they face an array of societal pressures, and \"Gattaca\" confronts the idea of genetic engineering and social hierarchy\u2014ideas that are increasingly relevant in our world today. The film inspires viewers to challenge preconceived notions about ability and success\u2014values that align closely with the journeys our seniors are about to embark on. \n\nMoreover, the resilience that Vincent demonstrates is an essential trait that can apply to any walk of life, whether in business, the military, or personal relationships. \n\nI appreciate your thoughts on \"Saving Private Ryan,\" but I truly think \"Gattaca\" would resonate on a more personal level for these students.
