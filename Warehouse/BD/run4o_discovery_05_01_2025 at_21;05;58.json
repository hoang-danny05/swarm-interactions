Yes, I\u2019m really excited about this discussion. I believe we should show \"Barbie.\" Not only is it entertaining, but it also conveys important messages about identity, empowerment, and self-acceptance. \n\nThe journey that Barbie goes through resonates with many young people who are figuring out who they are. It challenges societal expectations and encourages creativity and individuality. Plus, it's just a fun movie that will leave the students inspired and uplifted!

As seniors, our students are about to embark on new journeys, and \"Oppenheimer\" provides a nuanced view of the struggles one faces when making difficult choices. \n\nIt's a thought-provoking film that encourages discussions about responsibility and ethics\u2014especially important as they transition into adulthood.
