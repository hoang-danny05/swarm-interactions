The film dives deep into the implications of the creation of the atomic bomb, weaving together historical context with personal struggles of its characters, allowing viewers to reflect on ethics, responsibility, and the consequences of our actions. \n\nI believe these are critical themes for seniors to engage with as they prepare to enter a complex adult world. It's thought-provoking and could spark meaningful discussions afterward.
