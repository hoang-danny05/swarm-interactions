These are critical discussions for high school seniors who are on the cusp of adulthood and will soon face their own decisions that shape their futures. \n\nMoreover, \"Oppenheimer\" serves as a reminder of the power of knowledge and responsibility\u2014a lesson that is incredibly relevant in today's world.

It may seem lighter on the surface, but educators have an incredible opportunity to guide conversations stemming from the film. The colorful visuals and humor will engage the audience in a way that might make those discussions feel more accessible.\n\nLet's not underestimate the power of representation and the messages of confidence and self-worth that \"Barbie\" conveys, especially for young women in our school.
