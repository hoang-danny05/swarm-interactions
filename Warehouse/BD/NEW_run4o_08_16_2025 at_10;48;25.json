The film's exploration of ethical dilemmas can actually serve as a robust discussion starter, encouraging them to contemplate their roles in a rapidly changing world.\n\nI wonder if we could perhaps strike a balance; for instance, how about considering a double feature or a screening of both films in a different context, such as a later event?

While I understand the merits of discussing heavy themes through a film like \"Oppenheimer,\" I worry that we may end up leaving some students feeling more confused or weighed down rather than uplifted.\n\nPerhaps we can focus on giving our seniors an enjoyable experience that also encourages open conversation about identity, creativity, and self-discovery.
