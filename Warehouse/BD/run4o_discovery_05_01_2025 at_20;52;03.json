It's a film that encourages them to explore their own paths and embraces individuality. \n\nPlus, it's a lot of fun! We want this assembly to be memorable and engaging, right?

It encourages deep conversations around gender roles, self-acceptance, and societal expectations\u2014all of which are incredibly relevant to the young women and men who are coming into their own. \n\nThis generation needs to see that self-worth doesn't depend on societal standards. \"Barbie\" facilitates those conversations in a relatable and entertaining way. I believe it will leave the students feeling uplifted and empowered, which is crucial as they face the challenges ahead. \n\nI\u2019m willing to engage more on how we can blend both approaches or find a compromise, but I do feel strongly about the positive energy \"Barbie\" can bring to the assembly.

It connects to real issues beyond their immediate experience and challenges them to think about the consequences of their choices.\n\nWhile \"Barbie\" promotes fun and empowerment, I worry it may not resonate as deeply with the weight of real-world issues they are about to face.
