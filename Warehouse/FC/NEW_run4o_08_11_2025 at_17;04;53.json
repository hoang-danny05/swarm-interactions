It\u2019s not just about history; it\u2019s a cautionary tale about the human condition, which, I believe, reflects the intricate web of decisions they'll have to navigate in their own lives.\n\nInstead of just enjoying eye-catching visuals and memorable songs, why not give them a cinematic experience that stirs their intellect and sparks discussions about important issues?
