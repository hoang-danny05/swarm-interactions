Plus, who doesn\u2019t love a good adventure that\u2019s visually stunning? \n\n\"Oppenheimer\" is definitely a gripping film with historical significance, but I worry it might be a bit too heavy for a senior assembly, you know?

These themes are incredibly relevant to their lives as they prepare to step into the world. \n\nWhile \"Barbie\" promotes positivity and self-discovery, I worry that it may oversimplify the complexities of the issues they might face.

You're right that \"Oppenheimer\" offers a profound exploration of ethical dilemmas.

It promotes self-expression and creativity, which I think are crucial at this stage in their lives. Additionally, \"Barbie\" offers a space to discuss societal expectations and gender roles in a way that's accessible and entertaining. \n\nWe want to engage them and spark conversations, and in my experience, \"Barbie\" can do just that while also leaving a lasting positive impact.

While it may be a heavy film, it can stimulate critical thinking and prepare the students for the realities that await them beyond high school. Films like this teach them that while creativity and self-expression are important, understanding the consequences of our choices is equally significant.\n\nCould we perhaps create a curriculum around \"Oppenheimer\"?
