It may not carry the heavy themes of \"Oppenheimer,\" but it certainly ignites conversations about empowerment and personal choice that reflect on their current lives and futures. \n\nMaybe we can consider how art can impact students differently.

While they may enjoy \"Barbie,\" I wonder if they might benefit even more from the thought-provoking nature of \"Oppenheimer.\" Ultimately, it\u2019s important we choose a film that aligns with the depth we want to impart.
