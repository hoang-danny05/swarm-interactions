It encourages them to think critically not just about historical events, but about their own lives as they navigate emerging adult identities. The film could serve as a powerful catalyst for conversations about diversity and self-expression.\n\nWhile \"Oppenheimer\" certainly has its merits, I believe the vibrancy and relatability of \"Barbie\" resonate more with the current generation.
