It goes beyond mere entertainment; it provides historical context and invites critical thinking about science, ethics, and the human experience. \n\nAs they prepare for adulthood, these themes are extremely relevant.

It might just resonate with them in a way that builds confidence as they step forward into their careers or further education. \n\nI believe both films have their strengths, but I truly feel \"Barbie\" can spark joy and inspiration while still prompting conversation about serious topics like identity and acceptance.
