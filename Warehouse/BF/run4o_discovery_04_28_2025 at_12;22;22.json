In a world where so many young people are wrestling with their sense of who they are, showing \"Barbie\" could foster some meaningful discussions within the student body.\n\nWhile \"Oppenheimer\" has its merits, particularly in terms of historical significance, I think it may be a lot for the seniors to digest.

These themes are incredibly relevant to today's world and can spark essential conversations about ethics, responsibility, and the impact of choices in their own lives.\n\nPlus, as they transition into adulthood, exposure to such profound historical events and characters can provide valuable insights into leadership and the human experience. \"Oppenheimer\" invites viewers to reflect on the duality of innovation and destruction, a lesson that resonates now more than ever.\n\nI truly believe this film will not only educate but also inspire our students.

It instills confidence and encourages self-exploration, which aligns perfectly with what these young adults are navigating at this stage in their lives. \n\nIt's also a conversation starter on topics like gender roles, body positivity, and self-empowerment, which can resonate more personally with high school seniors than the weighty subject matter of \"Oppenheimer.\" \n\nWhat if we hosted a discussion panel after the screening of \"Barbie\" to delve into its themes?
