I believe it offers a fresh perspective that's just as vital as the historical insights from \"Oppenheimer.\" Plus, it has humor and heart, which can really resonate with the seniors heading into a new chapter of their lives.\n\nUltimately, we want to choose a film that leaves them feeling empowered and inspired.
