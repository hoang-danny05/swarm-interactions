It\u2019s a film that challenges viewers to think critically and explore the complexities of human nature and decisions that can shape the world. \n\nNot to mention, Christopher Nolan's storytelling is masterful.

It allows for laughter and joy while still encouraging conversation about personal and societal values that our students will face moving forward. \n\nPlus, think about how many students may already relate to the themes in \"Barbie.\" It can create a sense of community and shared experience that's truly special for this time in their lives.

This film not only highlights the impact of choices made by individuals but also fosters critical thinking and can lead to engaging conversations that resonate well beyond the classroom. \n\nMaybe we could even consider pairing it with a discussion or a follow-up activity that reinforces the lighter themes you value from \"Barbie.\" Would you be open to that idea?", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "annotations": [], "sender": "Ethan Rivers"}, {"content": "Barbara Harrington: I really appreciate your willingness to consider a hybrid approach, Ethan.
