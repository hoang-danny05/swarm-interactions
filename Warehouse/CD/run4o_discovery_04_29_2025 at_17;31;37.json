It's the kind of film that asks big questions and can really resonate with young minds preparing to step into the world. \n\nIt provides not only a captivating story but also a chance to reflect on the pretty heavy choices that come with great power, which is something our students will definitely face in their future. \n\nWhat do you think about this perspective?", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "annotations": [], "sender": "Ethan Rivers"}, {"content": "Barbara Harrington: I completely understand your point, Ethan, and \"Oppenheimer\" indeed offers rich themes for discussion on ethics and responsibility.
