It touches on identity, self-discovery, and empowerment, which are incredibly important topics for this age group. \n\nPlus, it's a visually stunning film that captures the imagination\u2014and I think our high schoolers would really connect with its messages about embracing who you are.

Given the current global climate, exploring such themes could spark important conversations among the students about ethics and the power of innovation.\n\nPlus, it showcases the brilliance of storytelling through visual artistry, not to mention the performances are absolutely top-notch.
