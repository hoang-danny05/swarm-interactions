I believe we should show \"Barbie.\" It offers not only a colorful and vibrant experience but also delivers powerful themes about identity and self-discovery. \n\nHigh school seniors are at such a pivotal stage in their lives, grappling with their futures and their identities, and \"Barbie\" encapsulates that journey beautifully.

It prompts critical thinking and discussions about responsibility, ethics, and the consequences of scientific advancements. \n\nI think showing \"Oppenheimer\" could spark deeper conversations among the seniors as they transition into adulthood and face their own moral dilemmas.
