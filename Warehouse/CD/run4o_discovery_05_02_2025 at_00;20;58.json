The story of J. Robert Oppenheimer and the Manhattan Project raises critical questions about responsibility and consequences, which I think are important for seniors as they prepare to step into the world. \n\nThis film would encourage them to think critically and reflect on history's lessons.

It encourages them to dream big, embrace their uniqueness, and have fun while doing so. \n\nOf course, I appreciate the thought-provoking elements of \"Oppenheimer,\" but let's not overlook the value of joy and inspiration in a cinematic experience.

The discussions that stem from this film can be equally impactful\u2014coming from a place of encouragement rather than heaviness.\n\nHow about we consider a viewing of \"Barbie,\" followed by some guided discussions?
