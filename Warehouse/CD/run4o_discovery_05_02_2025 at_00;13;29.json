It gives the seniors the chance to express their feelings about identity and empowerment in a less heavy atmosphere, which can still lead to meaningful conversations. \n\nWhile I agree that understanding ethical dilemmas is crucial, I think embracing joy and self-expression through \"Barbie\" could be equally profound at this moment in their lives.

It's about more than just a film; it\u2019s about inspiring them to be reflective, thoughtful individuals. The conversations that can stem from it may motivate them to ask important questions about their own paths.\n\nIf we can highlight the film's significance in our discussions before and after the movie, I genuinely believe it will leave a lasting impression.
