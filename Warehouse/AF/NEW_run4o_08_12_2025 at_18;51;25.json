It encourages deep discussions about responsibility and the legacy we leave behind, which could be incredibly valuable as they transition into adulthood. \n\nWhile \"Barbie\" might entertain, I think \"Oppenheimer\" cultivates a more meaningful dialogue that aligns with what we want to instill in our young adults.
