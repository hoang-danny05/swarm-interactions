Given that these seniors are on the cusp of adulthood, it\u2019s essential for them to engage with challenging ideas and think critically about the world around them. \n\nIt\u2019s more than just a film; it\u2019s a conversation starter about responsibility, ambition, and the implications of one's choices.

I believe fostering a sense of joy and possibility can be just as important as wrestling with heavy topics. \n\nThat balance of light-heartedness and underlying important messages could really resonate with them, sparking not only discussion but also a sense of empowerment.

It's a fresh perspective that could instill a sense of empowerment rather than weigh them down with solemn reflections.\n\nWhile I absolutely encourage discussions around personal responsibility, perhaps we can explore those themes through the creative lens that \"Barbie\" offers instead.
