It\u2019s not merely a historical film; it's a conversation starter that can provoke deep discussions about ethics, innovation, and the human condition\u2014topics that are very relevant today.\n\nWhile \"Barbie\" has its merits, I think \"Oppenheimer\" will leave a lasting impact on the students, encouraging them to engage critically with the world around them.
