A movie that resonates emotionally can really stick with them, prompting critical thought long after the film ends.

It can serve as a foundation for them to explore how they can take responsibility for their future in meaningful ways.\n\nWhile I respect the importance of joy and creativity, I\u2019m convinced that giving them the chance to grapple with complex themes might be the most valuable gift we can offer them as they transition into adulthood.
