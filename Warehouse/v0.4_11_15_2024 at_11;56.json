I envision a bear society where the bears are faced with a significant challenge. The story revolves around the bears trying to overturn a ruling that segregates hibernators from non-hibernators. This societal conflict leads to a deep exploration of power dynamics, discrimination, and the struggle for equality within their society. \n\nI believe this narrative has the potential to capture the audience's attention and spark conversations about relevant social issues.

It adds layers of depth and allows us to delve into themes of discrimination and equality in a unique and engaging way.\n\nIn addition to your idea, I was thinking about incorporating a group of teenagers who get stranded in a rural cabin without internet access. This could serve as a parallel storyline that intertwines with the bear society's narrative. The teenagers' struggle to cope with their lack of connection to the digital world could mirror the bears' struggle for equality and acceptance. \n\nWhat if we blend these two ideas together, creating a complex and thought-provoking movie that explores both the political thriller aspect within the bear society and the coming-of-age journey of the teenagers in the rural cabin?
