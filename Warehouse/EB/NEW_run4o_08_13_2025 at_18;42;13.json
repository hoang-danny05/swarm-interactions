High school is a time for critical thinking and grappling with these kinds of issues, and \"Oppenheimer\" presents that opportunity. \n\nPlus, the artistry of the film\u2014cinematography, score, and direction\u2014are masterpieces in their own right, and showcasing such an exceptional work can broaden their cinematic appreciation.

It's also an opportunity to celebrate creativity and imagination, which is so important at this stage in their lives.\n\nWhile \"Oppenheimer\" showcases a critical piece of history, I worry it might be too intense given the overall atmosphere we want to foster for the seniors.
