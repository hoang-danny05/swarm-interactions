By presenting them with thought-provoking material, we\u2019re not only entertaining but also empowering them to think more broadly about their roles in society. \n\nUltimately, I think \"Oppenheimer\" will resonate more deeply as they prepare to face the complexities of the world outside high school, but I\u2019m open to hearing more about how you feel \"Barbie\" connects with that.

It's a movie that can inspire confidence and creativity, encouraging them to embrace who they are as they step into the next chapter of their lives.\n\nThe laughter and joy from \"Barbie\" can foster a positive atmosphere filled with camaraderie, which I think is vital as we wrap up these years together in high school.
