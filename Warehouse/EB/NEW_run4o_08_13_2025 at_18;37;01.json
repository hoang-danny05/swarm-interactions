Given our students are about to embark on a new chapter in their lives, this resonates so well with them.\n\nPlus, the vibrant visuals and the clever humor make it an engaging watch.

It pushes viewers to engage critically with the decisions that changed the world and examines themes of responsibility, ethics, and the pursuit of knowledge. \n\nAt this pivotal moment in their lives, I feel high school seniors can benefit greatly from reflecting on the weight of their actions and understanding the historical context of their choices.

The engaging narrative encourages viewers to embrace themselves while also allowing them to have a good laugh, which can be incredibly beneficial as they prepare for life beyond high school. \n\nNot every film has to be heavy to be impactful!
