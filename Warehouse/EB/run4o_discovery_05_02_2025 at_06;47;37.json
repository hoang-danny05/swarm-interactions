The vibrant visuals and fun storytelling can engage them while also prompting conversations about gender roles, self-identity, and the importance of individuality.\n\nI believe the film can spark joy and inspire creativity, allowing the students to reflect on their dreams without the heavy weight that \"Oppenheimer\" carries.
