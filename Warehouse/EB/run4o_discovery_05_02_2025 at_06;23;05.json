It encourages critical thinking about history, science, and ethics, and I think it can inspire some meaningful discussions among the students. \n\nWhile \"Barbie\" may be entertaining, \"Oppenheimer\" offers a deeper narrative that could resonate with them as they navigate their futures.

It engages emotions in a way that is accessible and relatable for our students\u2014especially after a challenging school year. \n\nThat said, I recognize the merits of broader themes, but I wonder if we can find a compromise.

It's essential for them to leave the assembly with a sense of joy and empowerment. \n\nMaybe we could consider showing \"Oppenheimer\" in a future educational setting where we can host a discussion around it?

Engaging them in this way might lead to a richer understanding of their role in society.
