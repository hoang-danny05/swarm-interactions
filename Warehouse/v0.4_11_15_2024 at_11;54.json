I believe we should create a political thriller set in a bear society. The story will revolve around the bears trying to overturn a ruling that segregated hibernators from non-hibernators. \n\nThis concept allows us to delve into themes of equality, justice, and overcoming societal divisions.

I can see how we can explore complex character dynamics and delve into important social themes with that setting. \n\nIn addition to your idea, I propose incorporating elements of a coming-of-age story into the movie. What if we introduce a group of teenage bears who are caught in the midst of this societal turmoil? Their journey could involve them questioning the status quo, developing friendships across hibernation divides, and ultimately playing a key role in bringing about change in the bear society. \n\nThis way, we can appeal to both younger audiences through the teenage bear characters and older audiences through the political thriller aspect.

This approach will allow us to delve deeper into the complexity of the bear society and the challenges they face.\n\nI'm confident that this political thriller idea has the potential to be a compelling and thought-provoking film that resonates with a wide audience.
