It reflects on societal expectations, femininity, and personal choice\u2014all ideas that are incredibly relevant for a young audience grappling with their identities.

These themes are timeless and can lead to a deeper understanding of the world they will soon navigate.\n\nWhile \"Barbie\" does offer a fun perspective on identity, I worry that it may not provide the same depth of engagement that \"Oppenheimer\" could.

It engages with contemporary issues in a way that's accessible and enjoyable for the students, allowing them to dive into heavy themes without it feeling overwhelmingly serious. \n\nSometimes, humor and creativity can pave the way for profound insights. We could think about how \"Barbie\" gives them space to reflect on their identities and societal pressures while still keeping the atmosphere a bit lighter.
