I believe it can serve as a catalyst for deep conversations about the role of science and ethics in their upcoming lives, shaping their perspectives as they enter a world filled with complexities.\n\nI see your point about balance, but I believe that \u201cOppenheimer\u201d challenges students to think critically and reflectively, which is an invaluable skill as they move forward.
