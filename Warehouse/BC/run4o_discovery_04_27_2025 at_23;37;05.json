Plus, it sparks meaningful conversations about societal norms and self-discovery that are highly relevant for seniors ready to step into the world.\n\n\"Oppenheimer\" is certainly a captivating story, but it may not engage the students in the same way. \"Barbie\" allows for enjoyment and reflection.

It allows students to engage with history and ethics, encouraging critical thinking about the choices that shape our world. \n\nWhile entertaining, \"Barbie\" may not spark the same level of intellectual curiosity or discussion relevant to their upcoming transition to adulthood.

Plus, it could lead to insightful discussions about societal expectations without overwhelming them with the heaviness of historical narratives.\n\nIt\u2019s important for us to choose a film that resonates with where they are in their lives right now.

I think \"Oppenheimer\" can prepare them for those challenges in a way that \"Barbie\" may not. \n\nI genuinely want to find common ground.
