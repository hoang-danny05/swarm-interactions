As we know, this film offers a rich historical context and can spark deep discussions about ethics and leadership. \n\nIt's more than just a movie; it's a chance for our seniors to confront challenging themes that resonate with real-world issues.

By analyzing the moral dilemmas faced by Oppenheimer and his team, we can inspire our seniors to think critically about their own futures and the impact of their choices.\n\nLet's also consider that exposure to different themes can encourage them to explore various viewpoints, which is crucial in today\u2019s world. I think providing that opportunity is just as important as creating a celebratory atmosphere. \n\nI'm open to exploring a compromise here, as I genuinely want what's best for our students.

We can leverage the summer break or even a club event to delve deeper into the themes it addresses. It would provide a space for those deeper conversations while still keeping this assembly fun and joyful.
