They not only encourage individuality but can also generate a sense of unity. Think about the various types of hats people can wear: while some might choose a wizard hat or a cowboy hat, others could opt for a baseball cap or even a comically oversized one. \n\nPlus, we all have some kind of personal story tied to a hat, whether it's a family tradition or a memorable event.
