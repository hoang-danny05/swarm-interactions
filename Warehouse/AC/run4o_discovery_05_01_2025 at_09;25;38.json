I think it will resonate with the students on a personal level, making it memorable as they head into their next chapter. Plus, it can lead to fun discussions about empowerment, which is integral during this stage of their lives. \n\nCould we consider how much fun and relatability \"Barbie\" offers alongside those weighty topics?
