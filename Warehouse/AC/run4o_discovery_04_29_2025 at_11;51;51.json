I mean, these seniors are at a point in their lives where they need something uplifting and inspiring to cap off their high school journey, don\u2019t you think? \n\nPlus, \"Barbie\" has this fantastic blend of humor and heart that I think would really resonate with them!

While it may seem heavy, it also opens the door for important discussions about ethics and the impact of our choices, especially as they transition into adulthood. \n\nIt\u2019s a film that encourages critical thinking and reflection, which could be invaluable for them at this stage in their lives.

Plus, it breaks down barriers and stereotypes in such a colorful and entertaining way. They can take those themes and apply them in their lives just as much as they can with the heavy themes in \"Oppenheimer.\"\n\nI think the atmosphere of celebration and enjoyment is what they need more right now.

Celebrating graduation can include recognizing the weight of decisions and the impact they have on the world around us. \n\nHow about we consider a compromise?
