It pushes students to think critically about history and the choices we make, and these lessons are timeless and essential.\n\n\"Barbie,\" while entertaining, doesn't quite offer the same depth or thought-provoking discussions that \"Oppenheimer\" does.

It highlights the importance of making informed choices, especially when it comes to complex issues that can shape the world. \n\nThat said, I do appreciate the idea of engaging discussions around \"Barbie,\" but perhaps we could consider it as a secondary option for a future event, like a spring gathering or movie night?

It invites them to explore both serious and light-hearted topics relevant to their lives. It's a film that encourages dialogue about identity and choices, helping them understand themselves and their future paths in a relatable way. \n\nI\u2019m wondering if there's a compromise we can find.
