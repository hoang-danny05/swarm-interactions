My concern is that while we entertain, we also inform our students about the weight of history and the real choices people had to confront. \n\nI\u2019d like to stick with \"Oppenheimer\" for its depth\u2014it's a conversation that could continue far beyond the assembly.

I truly believe \"Barbie\" can capture that spirit effectively.
