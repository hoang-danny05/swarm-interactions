Given that they are at an age where they're figuring themselves out, a film like \"Barbie\" can empower them to embrace their individuality and challenge societal expectations in a light-hearted yet impactful manner. \n\nI believe the students would leave feeling uplifted, rather than weighed down by heavy themes.
