It encourages them to think critically about history and the ethical dilemmas that come with power and innovation, which I feel can be profound for this age group.\n\nMoreover, Christopher Nolan's storytelling is exceptional, and the cinematography offers a stunning visual experience that will leave a lasting impact.

It's a movie that can elicit joy and positivity, offering a necessary escape from the stress and pressures they face, especially as they approach graduation. \n\nThere\u2019s room for deeper conversations through its humor and relatability.

It might inspire them to take a more thoughtful approach to their own lives and the impact they can have on society. \n\nThat said, I recognize that providing a lighthearted experience is valuable as well!

It's not just a light-hearted movie; it encompasses messages of resilience, creativity, and the importance of being true to oneself. \n\nMaybe, instead of a compromise with the movies themselves, we could consider a panel discussion hosted after the viewing of \"Barbie,\" where we can talk about deeper themes of identity, society, and gender.
