Robert Oppenheimer, a brilliant scientist who grappled with the moral complexities of his work. This kind of depth can foster important discussions among the students about ethics in science, technology, and even their own lives as they make pivotal choices.\n\nI think it could serve as a springboard for meaningful conversations about their future and the kind of impact they want to have.
