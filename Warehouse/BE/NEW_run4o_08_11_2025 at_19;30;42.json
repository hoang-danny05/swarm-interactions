I believe exposing them to such deep narratives could be a pivotal moment in their educational experience.

It\u2019s not just about heavy themes; it\u2019s about understanding the consequences of our actions and choices. \n\nWe could even facilitate discussions afterward to really dive into what they\u2019ve just viewed.

Exposure to these complex issues can create well-rounded individuals who can engage in difficult conversations with nuance.\n\nThat said, I see your passion for \"Barbie,\" and I think we both want what\u2019s best for the students.

I feel that engaging with such significant themes will not only prepare them for their futures but will also help cultivate a sense of responsibility for the world they inhabit.\n\nPerhaps each film could be shown in a different context?
