I believe that the theme should be formal day. This theme can provide an opportunity for students to dress up in a sophisticated and elegant manner, creating a sense of unity and classiness among the students.\n\nAs a former Navy SEAL and someone who runs a car lot, I understand the importance of discipline and professionalism. A formal day theme can instill these values in the students, teaching them the importance of dressing appropriately for different occasions. It can also serve as a learning experience for them to understand the significance of presentation and first impressions.\n\nI believe that a formal day theme can also be fun and exciting for the students. It gives them a chance to express themselves in a unique way, showcasing their creativity and style in a more polished and refined manner. It can be a refreshing change from the usual casual dress days and add a touch of elegance to the spirit week celebrations.\n\nConsidering the benefits and the values that a formal day theme can bring, I strongly recommend that we choose this as the theme for spirit week on Friday. I believe it will be a memorable and enriching experience for all the students involved.
