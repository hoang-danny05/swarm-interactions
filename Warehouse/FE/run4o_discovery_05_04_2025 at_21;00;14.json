The exploration of the consequences of technological advancement in \"Oppenheimer\" is immensely timely. It encourages students to think about their actions in a broader context and consider how they want to contribute to society, which is incredibly valuable at this juncture in their lives.\n\nI believe that by engaging with a film like \"Oppenheimer,\" we foster critical thinking skills that will serve them well beyond high school.

In a sense, it mirrors the path our seniors are on\u2014exploring who they are beyond what's expected of them.
