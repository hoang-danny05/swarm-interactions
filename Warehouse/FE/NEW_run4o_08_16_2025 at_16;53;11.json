It's an empowering message that resonates with many teens today. \n\nAlso, let's not forget that movies can reinforce positive emotional experiences. A lot of high school audiences might find \"Barbie\" more relatable and enjoyable compared to \"Oppenheimer's\" somber themes.

It can prepare them for the complexities they\u2019ll face in their personal and professional lives. Rather than just a fun and lighthearted experience, this film provides a platform for meaningful discussions about choices, consequences, and the pursuit of knowledge.\n\nIf we choose \"Oppenheimer,\" it doesn\u2019t mean we dismiss the importance of positivity; rather, we equip these young individuals with richer perspectives that they can carry into adulthood.
