It showcases the intricate balance between innovation and its moral implications. These are conversations we should encourage our seniors to engage in as they step into their futures.\n\nWhile \"Barbie\" offers great discussions centered around empowerment, I believe \"Oppenheimer\" provides a deeper dive into historical context and the weight of decisions in life.
