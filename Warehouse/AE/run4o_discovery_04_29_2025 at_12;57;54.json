It allows our students to reflect on who they are and the larger issues of self-acceptance and societal expectations, opening up the dialogue in a relatable and engaging way, which might resonate more with them at this stage of their lives.\n\nPlus, \"Barbie\" incorporates humor, creativity, and a sense of fun, which could make for a memorable experience.
