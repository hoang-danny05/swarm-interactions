Those are crucial issues for high school seniors as they're gearing up to step out into the real world. It's relatable and thought-provoking while also being entertaining.

The film shines a light on complexities in history and science that can spark important discussions about ethics and responsibility.\n\nPlus, it\u2019s directed by Christopher Nolan, so the storytelling and cinematography are just phenomenal.

It's a feel-good film that encourages self-acceptance and creativity. \n\nI genuinely think that \"Barbie\" could provide a bridge for those deeper conversations in a more accessible format.

It gives them a chance not only to unwind, but also to engage with serious content relevant to their futures.\n\nI\u2019m really invested in this perspective because I truly believe in the value of this film for their development.
