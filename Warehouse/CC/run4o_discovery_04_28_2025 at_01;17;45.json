It's a fresh lens on self-discovery and what it means to forge your own path, which is something every high schooler is grappling with.\n\nNot to mention, the artistry, humor, and creativity of \"Barbie\" will likely resonate more with the student body as a whole.

It might also encourage them to appreciate the complexity of the world around them.\n\nWhat if we framed it as a discussion around both films?

We could even incorporate a discussion session afterward to compare both films' messages. \n\nBut ultimately, I still think that \"Barbie\" leads to a more inclusive and engaging viewing experience that senior year deserves.

The weight of the themes in \"Oppenheimer\" will leave a lasting impression, while also instigating important conversations about ethics and responsibility. \n\nI see where you're coming from with the positive and fun experience that \"Barbie\" can bring, but voting for \"Oppenheimer\" gives us the chance to discuss its critical themes at such an important stage of their lives without shying away from more serious issues. I\u2019m open to discussing \"Barbie\" more as a supplementary topic, but I really feel that \u201cOppenheimer\u201d should take the spotlight this time.

I'd really love to see \"Barbie\" uplift the students and lead to invigorating dialogues about self-image and societal roles, which are vital as they navigate the transition into adulthood.\n\nSo, to wrap it up, I still advocate for \"Barbie\" as the movie to show.

It\u2019s about cultivating their understanding of the world and instilling a sense of duty for what lies ahead.\n\nCan we revisit the significance of what they could take away from \u201cOppenheimer\u201d in contrast to \u201cBarbie\u201d?
