The message of empowerment, embracing individuality, and challenging societal norms are crucial for them at this stage in life. \n\nPlus, it\u2019s visually stunning and has a great mix of humor and heart.

It\u2019s not just entertainment; it's a thought-provoking experience that can inspire meaningful conversations. \n\nThe storytelling in \"Oppenheimer\" is exceptional, blending drama, tension, and real historical context.
