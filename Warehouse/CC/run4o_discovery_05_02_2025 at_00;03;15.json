It allows students to engage with historical events in a meaningful way, sparking discussions about ethics and responsibility. Plus, it offers a chance to dive into the complexities of human emotion and intellect that can truly resonate with them at this point in their lives.\n\nI think it\u2019s essential to challenge students, especially as they are on the brink of adulthood, to think critically about the world around them and \"Oppenheimer\" does just that. It\u2019s powerful storytelling with a significant message.
