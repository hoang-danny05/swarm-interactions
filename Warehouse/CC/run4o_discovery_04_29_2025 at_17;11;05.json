It can inspire them to embrace their individuality.\n\nAlso, \"Barbie\" can create an inclusive atmosphere that everyone can enjoy, while \"Oppenheimer\" might alienate some students who are less inclined towards heavier themes or historical contexts. \n\nSo, I wonder if we can find a balance between fun and depth with \"Barbie.\" What do you think about the potential for connecting with a broader audience with that choice?", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "annotations": [], "sender": "Kyle Reed"}, {"content": "Ethan Rivers: I genuinely see the value in what you're saying, Kyle. \"Barbie\" certainly has the potential to connect with a wide audience and foster a fun, inclusive environment.
