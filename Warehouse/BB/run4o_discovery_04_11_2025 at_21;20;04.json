Not only does it engage with historical events, but it also encourages critical thinking \u2013 something that I believe is vital as they prepare for adulthood. \n\nI recognize that \"Oppenheimer\" presents heavier themes, but I feel that the students are at a stage where they can appreciate and critically engage with such material.

It inspires creativity and joy, which is often just as critical at this stage in their lives. \"Barbie\" encourages self-expression and provides a sense of community and togetherness as they approach graduation. \n\nMaybe we could think about doing something special with \"Barbie\" like having a discussion panel afterward where students could engage in critical conversations about the issues it raises, aligning it closely with the moral implications you're concerned with. This way, we can have both the uplifting themes of \"Barbie\" and still engage in meaningful dialogue afterward.

It encourages students to think critically about the consequences of scientific advancements, and I believe that could have a lasting impact on them as they transition into adulthood. \n\nI understand the desire for a more light-hearted film at a school assembly, but I think \"Oppenheimer\" is a more powerful choice for stimulating meaningful reflection.

As they're about to embark on their futures, the uplifting and relatable themes in \"Barbie\" might create a more accessible conversation about identity and self-worth, making it easier for them to engage with.\n\nPerhaps we can find common ground in this, discussing ways to highlight the lessons of responsibility and choice through the lens of \"Barbie\" while accepting that lighter films can also be profound.
