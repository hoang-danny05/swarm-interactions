It encourages critical thinking about the implications of their choices and the impact they can make. While it might be more intense, I believe it sparks meaningful conversations that go beyond just entertainment.\n\nPlus, as these students are about to graduate, giving them a deeper narrative to reflect on could be inspiring.
