It encourages young adults to chase their dreams, which I think is essential as they prepare for their future.\n\nWhile \"Oppenheimer\" is a compelling film, it may not capture the lightheartedness and celebratory nature that a high school assembly should have.

It's a powerful story rooted in history, touching upon essential themes of intellect and ethical dilemmas that I think our seniors should reflect upon as they transition into the real world. \n\nPlus, it offers an opportunity for deeper discussions following the screening.

It can serve as a springboard for meaningful conversations about identity without weighing down on them with heavy themes right before graduation.\n\nI also think a movie that embraces creativity can spark inspiration in a different light\u2014something they can cherish and relate to as they transition into adulthood.

High school graduation is a monumental moment, and I think a film like \"Barbie,\" with its focus on aspirations and individuality, is more fitting to mark this important transition in their lives. \n\nHow about we consider the emotional impact that each film will have at this specific time?
