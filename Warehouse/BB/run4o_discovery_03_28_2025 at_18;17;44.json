I really believe we should go with \"Crazy Sock Day\" for Friday. \n\nI think it\u2019s a fun and quirky theme that encourages creativity.

Plus, they can really play with colors and patterns, allowing them to show off their personalities in a simpler, playful way.\n\nBut I\u2019m definitely open to finding a middle ground.
