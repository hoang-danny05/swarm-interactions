It\u2019s relatable, fun, and still offers layers of meaning regarding identity and self-worth. \n\nBesides, in today\u2019s environment, finding common ground through joyous and uplifting experiences can be equally as enriching as historical discussions.

This film can stir a curiosity that prompts deeper discussions, perhaps even inspiring some students to explore careers in science, ethics, or history.\n\nDon\u2019t you think that tackling these serious themes now might better prepare them for the real challenges of adulthood?

It invites students to explore their own identities and aspirations in a world that often imposes rigid expectations. Celebrating those moments of self-discovery and joy can unite the students in a positive way, helping them create lasting memories together.\n\nWhile I see the merit in choosing something that challenges their intellect, I also feel that balance is crucial.
