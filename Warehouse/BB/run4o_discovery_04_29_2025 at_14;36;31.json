Given that these seniors are at a pivotal point in their lives, I think it would offer them both entertainment and meaningful insights.\n\n\"Oppenheimer\" might be an excellent film in its own regards, but I worry it could be too heavy for a gathering meant to celebrate their milestones.

While \"Barbie\" is fun and colorful, \"Oppenheimer\" can provide a more profound and relatable experience as they face the challenges ahead.\n\nI understand your concerns about the film being heavy, but I think it's important to challenge our students and engage them with thought-provoking material.
