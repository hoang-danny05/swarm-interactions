This is not just a historical biopic; it's a profound exploration of the ethical dilemmas that come with innovation, which resonates deeply with young adults at this stage in their lives. \n\nBy watching this film, our seniors can engage in critical thinking about the impact of their choices, both on a personal and societal level.

It encourages individuality and celebrates diversity, which is especially relevant for seniors who are facing their futures with uncertainty. \n\nThe engaging visuals and playful narrative can provide a light-hearted break from the pressures of academia, allowing students to relax and enjoy themselves.
