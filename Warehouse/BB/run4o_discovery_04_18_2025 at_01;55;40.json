Yes, this is such an important decision.

It challenges them to think critically about scientific advancement and ethical dilemmas. The historical significance of the atomic bomb and its implications on modern society are discussions that could inspire and provoke thoughtful conversations among the students.\n\nPlus, the storytelling in \"Oppenheimer\" is compelling and sparks curiosity about history and human nature. I genuinely think it would leave a lasting impression on them.

Additionally, it promotes a sense of inclusivity and self-discovery that might resonate more closely with their experiences.\n\nWhile \"Oppenheimer\" definitely has its merits, I believe it may not connect with them on the same personal level. It's crucial to consider not only the themes but the engagement the students will have with the film. What do you think about finding a middle ground?

The film invites them to explore what it means to be themselves in a world full of expectations, which is a journey they are about to embark on.\n\nI think it can spark conversations about individuality and self-worth that are crucial at this stage in their lives.
