It\u2019s colorful, fun, and celebratory, creating an atmosphere that reflects their excitement for the future. \n\nWhile \"Oppenheimer\" may spark intellectual debates, I feel that \"Barbie\" provides an opportunity for our students to celebrate their individuality and explore their identities through a light-hearted lens.

The weight of leadership, the consequences of innovation, and the burden of historical events can shape not only their academic pursuits but also their role in society.\n\nImagine the conversations that could arise from watching \"Oppenheimer\": discussions on ethics in science, the responsibility of innovation, and how history informs our current choices.

It teaches that with great power\u2014whether it be scientific knowledge, creativity, or influence\u2014comes the need for ethical considerations and understanding one\u2019s impact on society.
