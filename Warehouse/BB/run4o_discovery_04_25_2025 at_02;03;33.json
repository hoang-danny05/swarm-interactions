It leaves the audience feeling empowered and optimistic, which could be incredibly uplifting as they prepare for graduation. \n\nFurthermore, the colorful aesthetic and whimsical narrative of \"Barbie\" could serve as a fun celebration of their achievements\u2014giving them a sense of nostalgia and excitement for the future, rather than focusing on the somber realities that \"Oppenheimer\" often portrays.\n\nI think we can foster impact without overwhelming them at this pivotal moment in their lives.
