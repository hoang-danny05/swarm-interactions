I believe that Friday should definitely be \"Crazy Sock Day.\" \n\nIt's not just a fun theme, but it also fosters creativity and self-expression among the kids.

From funny and elaborate hats to simple ones, there\u2019s so much room for creativity!

Socks are often hidden, so when the kids finally reveal their socks, it feels like a fun surprise!\n\nAlso, socks are something they wear daily, which could make them feel more connected to the theme.
