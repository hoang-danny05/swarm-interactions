These are crucial themes that resonate with young adults as they prepare to enter the world. Plus, it's an opportunity for them to engage in deeper discussions about history and the impact of choices, which could be really impactful for their growth. \n\nWhile \"Barbie\" provides entertainment and empowerment, \"Oppenheimer\" can inspire critical thinking and provide a profound understanding of a pivotal moment in history.

It can encourage the seniors to think about their impact on the world, much like the empowerment themes in \"Barbie.\" Plus, dealing with real-world consequences could spark meaningful discussions about responsibility and personal agency, which are also essential as they head into adulthood.\n\nI'm not against having fun or celebration, but I genuinely believe that \"Oppenheimer\" can offer both entertainment and a significant depth of conversation that \"Barbie\" might not provide in the same way.
