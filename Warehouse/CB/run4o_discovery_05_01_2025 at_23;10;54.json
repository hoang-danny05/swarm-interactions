It challenges them to think critically about the consequences of their actions and how they can shape the future. Plus, the historical context and character exploration would spark meaningful conversations among the students.\n\nI think it's crucial for our seniors to see a film that not only entertains but also encourages them to ponder their place in the world.

The decisions the characters face and the moral dilemmas presented can mirror the tough choices they'll encounter in their lives.\n\nWhat if we considered the potential impact of each film not just in isolation, but also how we can facilitate discussions around them afterwards?

The film\u2019s historical context could also deepen their understanding of the world\u2014not just in terms of entertainment, but as a foundation for becoming responsible adults.\n\nPerhaps we could frame \"Oppenheimer\" in a way that highlights its thought-provoking nature while still encouraging open dialogue about identity and choice?
