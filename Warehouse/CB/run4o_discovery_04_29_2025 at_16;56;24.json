Robert Oppenheimer and the development of the atomic bomb\u2014but it also prompts critical thinking about ethics in science, the consequences of our actions, and the moral dilemmas faced by individuals in positions of power. These are important themes for young adults on the brink of making significant life decisions.\n\n\"Oppenheimer\" challenges the audience intellectually and emotionally, which could lay a strong foundation for conversations that extend beyond the screening.

Moreover, \"Barbie\" has a lighthearted approach, offering not just entertainment but also powerful messages about self-empowerment and acceptance. \n\nI believe these themes will resonate more profoundly with them and spark joy, which can help in creating lasting memories as they take those important steps into adulthood. What if we considered doing a follow-up discussion or workshop that delves into the complexities of \"Oppenheimer\" and allows for deeper exploration of those themes?
