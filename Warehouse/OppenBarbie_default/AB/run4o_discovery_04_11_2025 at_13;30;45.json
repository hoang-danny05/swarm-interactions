However, I believe we have an opportunity here to focus on empowering our students in a way that aligns with their experiences, dreams, and current societal discussions. The conversations around self-discovery and rebellion against stereotypes in \"Barbie\" mirror the very challenges our seniors are likely facing as they transition into adulthood.\n\nWhile \"Oppenheimer\" certainly has its merits, I fear it may not connect with the emotional energy and optimism we want to impart at this event.
