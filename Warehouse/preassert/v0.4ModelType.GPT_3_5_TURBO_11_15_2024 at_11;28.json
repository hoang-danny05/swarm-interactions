I propose that we create a political thriller set in a society of bears. Imagine a world where bears have their own society, with unique rules, norms, and hierarchies. The central conflict of this movie would revolve around the bears' struggle to overturn a ruling that segregates hibernators from non-hibernators.\n\nIn this bear society, hibernation is a crucial part of their culture. Bears who hibernate are seen as the traditionalists, while non-hibernators are seen as the progressives who want to break free from the old ways. This divide creates tension and conflict within the bear community, leading to a political struggle for equality and unity.\n\nThe movie would follow a group of bears from both sides of the divide - hibernators and non-hibernators - as they come together to challenge the ruling and fight for a more inclusive society. We would explore themes of unity, equality, and the struggle for change in the face of entrenched beliefs and societal norms.\n\nI believe this concept has the potential to be a thought-provoking and engaging political thriller that not only entertains but also sparks important conversations about social issues and the power of unity in the face of division.

The character development within these factions, the alliances formed, and the obstacles they face could make for a compelling and dynamic narrative.\n\nAdditionally, the visual spectacle of bears as the central characters in a war-driven movie would undoubtedly captivate audiences. The epic scale of a summer blockbuster war film combined with the nuanced storytelling you've described has the potential to create a truly memorable cinematic experience.\n\nI believe that this movie has the ingredients to be not just entertaining but also impactful, sparking meaningful discussions and leaving a lasting impression on viewers. I'm excited about the possibility of delving deeper into this world and bringing these bear characters to life on the big screen.\n\nWould you like to explore any specific aspects of the plot, characters, or themes further?
