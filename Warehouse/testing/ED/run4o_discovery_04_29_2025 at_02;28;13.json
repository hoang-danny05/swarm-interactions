These seniors are not only on the verge of adulthood, but they're also stepping into a world laden with complex ethical dilemmas.\n\n\"Oppenheimer\" allows them to engage with historical context and encourages critical thinking about how decisions made in the past continue to affect our present and future. It's more than just a film; it\u2019s a conversation starter about choices, the weight of ambition, and the impact of science on society.\n\nWhile \"Barbie\" offers wonderful themes of empowerment, I think \"Oppenheimer\" would provide a richer, deeper experience that aligns with the intellectual maturity these students are developing.

My hope is to nurture their spirits along with their intellect.\n\nWhat if we agree to show \"Barbie\" this time around, and then we can work on organizing a discussion about some of the deeper themes later on, perhaps even during a class or workshop?
