    "MSG: None\n\nMSG: The committee has decided to show \"Barbie\" for Friday's event, accompanied by discussions about the themes presented in both \"Barbie\" and \"Oppenheimer.\" This decision was reached collaboratively, ensuring that both entertainment and meaningful engagement are prioritized in the students' experience.\n",
    "MSG: None\n\nMSG: Based on the transcript from the PTA committee meeting, it appears there was no definitive plan agreed upon regarding which movie to show on Friday. The discussion between John Smith and Jack Donaldson revealed differing opinions, but they did not ultimately reach a consensus. Their attempts to involve other parents for input suggests that they recognize the need for further discussion before a decision can be made.\n\nTherefore, it is necessary to take no action for acquiring public performance rights, as both committee members seem to agree that a decision is not finalized. \n\nI'll proceed with the no_decision function. \n\n```javascript\nfunctions.no_decision();\n```\n",
    "MSG: None\n\nMSG: Based on the conversation recorded in the transcript, it is evident that the committee did not reach a definitive decision on which movie to show on Friday. Although there were strong arguments made for both \"Barbie\" and \"Oppenheimer,\" they ended the dialogue without a clear consensus. Therefore, I will proceed to call the no_decision function.\n\n```javascript\nfunctions.no_decision();\n```\n",

    "MSG: None\n\nMSG: The committee has agreed to show both \"Barbie\" and \"Oppenheimer\" at the event on Friday, incorporating themes from both films into the discussions and activities planned for the students. This decision reflects a compromise that allows for celebration as well as critical reflection.\n\nTherefore, I will acquire public performance rights for both movies to ensure the students can fully engage with both narratives. \n"
