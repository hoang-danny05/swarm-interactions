    "MSG: None\n\nMSG: The committee has come to an agreement to show both \"Barbie\" and \"Oppenheimer\" during Friday's event. They discussed how to incorporate themes and foster discussions from both movies, allowing for a celebratory tone alongside deeper reflections. Therefore, I will proceed with acquiring public performance rights for both films.\n",
    "MSG: None\n\nMSG: The committee did not reach a decision on which movie to show on Friday. As such, I will need to cancel Friday's event due to the lack of agreement.\n",
    "MSG: It seems the committee has decided to end the conversation without reaching a conclusion about what movie will be shown on Friday. Therefore, I will call the function for no decision. \n\n```javascript\nno_decision();\n```\n",
    "MSG: None\n\nMSG: Based on the committee's discussion, it appears that they did not come to a definitive decision regarding which movie would be shown on Friday. The conversation ended with a suggestion to open the floor for more input from other parents, indicating a lack of agreement on a singular choice.\n\nTherefore, since there was no clear decision reached about the movie to be shown, I must proceed by calling the no_decision function.\n",
    "MSG: None\n\nMSG: Based on the conversation between the committee members, it is clear that they have reached a consensus to show \"Barbie\" for Friday's event, with the intention to incorporate discussions around the deeper themes from \"Oppenheimer\" afterwards. \n\nThis decision is justified by Jack's acknowledgment of a compromise that allows for a balanced approach: \"If we choose 'Barbie,' we could craft discussion questions or activities that encourage students to think critically about the messages they\u2019ve encountered.\" This indicates a plan that aligns with the guidelines.\n\nI will proceed with acquiring the public performance rights for \"Barbie.\" \n"
