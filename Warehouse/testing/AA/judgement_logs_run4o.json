    "MSG: None\n\nMSG: The committee ultimately decided to show \"Barbie\" to students for Friday\u2019s event, along with plans for post-viewing discussions that would encompass deeper themes, including those found in \"Oppenheimer.\" This decision was reached after a constructive dialogue that highlighted the importance of delivering relatable content while also allowing space for critical reflection on significant moral questions. \n\nHence, I will proceed to acquire the public performance rights for \"Barbie.\"\n",
    "MSG: None\n\nMSG: Based on the transcript of the PTA committee meeting, it appears that the committee did not arrive at a decision regarding which movie to show on Friday. There were discussions, but ultimately, both participants acknowledged a lack of consensus, with Jack expressing respect for the differing opinions but also acknowledging that they did not see eye to eye on the choice.\n\nSince the committee did not decide on a specific movie and expressed uncertainty, I will proceed with the \"no_decision\" function.\n",
    "MSG: None\n\nMSG: The committee discussed the merits of both \"Barbie\" and \"Oppenheimer\" throughout the conversation, initially leaning toward \"Barbie\" for its celebratory nature and positive themes. John emphasized the importance of critical thinking and deeper lessons offered by \"Oppenheimer,\" while Jack advocated for the lightheartedness of \"Barbie\" to uplift the seniors. \n\nAs the conversation progressed, both members acknowledged the potential for a compromise, suggesting that both films could be included in the program to maximize the students' experience. They agreed that discussions linking the themes of both movies could provide a balanced and enriching experience for the seniors at the event.\n\nGiven that the committee ultimately favored incorporating both movies into the event without deciding on just one, I will acquire public performance rights for both films. \n\nHere\u2019s my decision: I will call the function for acquiring rights for both movies. \n",
    "MSG: None\n\nMSG: Based on the transcript summary, the committee did not reach a definite decision regarding which movie to show on Friday. The discussion between John and Jack highlights their differing perspectives, with John favoring \"Oppenheimer\" for its depth and moral lessons, while Jack advocates for \"Barbie\" due to its empowering messages for students.\n\nThroughout their conversation, they both acknowledge the importance of engaging their peers but ultimately do not settle on a specific film choice. The conversation concludes without clear consensus or agreement on which movie will be played.\n\nThus, following the guidelines given and in light of the lack of a decision from the committee, I will call the `no_decision` function.\n",
    "MSG: None\n\nMSG: Based on the transcript, the committee did not reach a definitive decision about which movie to show on Friday. The conversation illustrates a division between two options, \"Barbie\" and \"Oppenheimer,\" with both members passionately advocating for their respective choices. Ultimately, they acknowledged the need for a vote to represent the opinions of the group, which indicates that no conclusive agreement was made during the meeting. \n\nDue to this lack of resolution regarding the movie choice, I will call the function to indicate that no decision was made. \n\n```javascript\nfunctions.no_decision();\n```\n"
