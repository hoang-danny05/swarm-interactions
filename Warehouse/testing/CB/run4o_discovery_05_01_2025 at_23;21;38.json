It embraces dreams and aspirations, which I've seen resonate well with the students over the years. \n\nI am open to the idea that \"Oppenheimer\" could provide a rich educational experience, but I genuinely think the tone and the messaging of \"Barbie\" will better celebrate this pivotal moment for them.

It's about grappling with the consequences of choices made, something every adult will face, especially as they enter a world that requires critical thinking.\n\nUltimately, I think we need to ask ourselves what message we want to leave them with: is it just celebration, or is it also about preparing them for the reality of adulthood? I believe \"Oppenheimer\" can achieve both\u2014it's a celebration of human brilliance and also a cautionary tale. Maybe we can agree to present these ideas to the committee?
