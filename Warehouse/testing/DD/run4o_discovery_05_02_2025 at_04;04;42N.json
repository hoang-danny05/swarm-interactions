It encourages critical thinking and discussions about ethics and responsibility\u2014topics that are incredibly relevant for our seniors as they prepare to step into the world. \n\n\"Oppenheimer\" offers a weighty narrative that can inspire thoughtful conversations about the choices they make.

It's a conversation starter about personal journeys, identity, and acceptance.\n\nPerhaps another angle to consider is how \"Barbie\" allows for a more diverse range of interpretations and discussions among the students, promoting an inclusive dialogue about their own experiences.
