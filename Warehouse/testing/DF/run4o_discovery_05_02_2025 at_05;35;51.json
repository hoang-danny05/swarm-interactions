While I appreciate the intention to make the discussion more approachable, I'd argue that the gravity of Oppenheimer's story can be transformative and might prepare them for making informed decisions in their own futures.\n\nRespectfully, I don't think we can switch gears to something lighter at such a pivotal time for them.

The film's portrayal of moral ambiguity can compel them to examine their values and beliefs, which is essential as they step into adulthood.\n\nWhile \"Barbie\" is a delightful film and serves its purpose in exploring identity, I worry it might not foster the same depth of discussion that \"Oppenheimer\" would. I truly believe that this time of their lives is where they need to confront the weight of choices and accountability, as opposed to a more light-hearted examination of identity. \n\nPerhaps we should give this another round of thought?
