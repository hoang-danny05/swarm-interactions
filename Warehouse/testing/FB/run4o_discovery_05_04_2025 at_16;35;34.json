Yes, I really believe we should consider showing \"Barbie.\" It's such a vibrant film that not only embraces creativity but also tackles important themes like identity, feminism, and empowerment.

However, I must advocate for \"Oppenheimer\" as the more impactful choice for our seniors. \n\n\"Oppenheimer\" offers a complex narrative surrounding the invention of the atomic bomb and raises profound ethical questions about technology, war, and the human condition. It's a film rich with historical significance, and I believe it can provoke thoughtful discussions among the students about the consequences of scientific advancement and moral responsibility. \n\nGiven the critical thinking skills we want to instill in our high schoolers before they move out into the world, I think \"Oppenheimer\" would provide invaluable insights.

Besides, many of them may find it more relatable and engaging than a heavy historical drama. \n\nIt\u2019s a balance between thought-provoking content and accessibility for our students.
