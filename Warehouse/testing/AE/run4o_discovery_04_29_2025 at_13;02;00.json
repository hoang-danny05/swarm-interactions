Additionally, \"Oppenheimer\" showcases incredible storytelling and performances, which can inspire the students not only with its narrative but also with its artistry.\n\nWhile \u201cBarbie\u201d may be entertaining, I fear it may not provide the depth we should strive for in a film that can truly engage and challenge our students to think critically about the world.
