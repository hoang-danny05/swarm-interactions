As seniors preparing to enter a world filled with important decisions, I believe that engaging with such profound themes could inspire them to reflect on their own paths. \n\nFurthermore, \"Oppenheimer\" showcases remarkable storytelling and cinematography, allowing students to appreciate the rich craft behind filmmaking. There\u2019s a significant value in exposing them to history and the ramifications of innovation\u2014lessons that are crucial as they step into adulthood. \n\nWhile I understand that \"Barbie\" brings fun and relatability, I believe that \"Oppenheimer\" could provide a more impactful experience.
