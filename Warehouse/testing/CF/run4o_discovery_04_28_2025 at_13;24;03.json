It invites students to engage with significant global issues and moral dilemmas, which is incredibly important as they prepare for adulthood.

Additionally, \"Barbie\" is vibrant and fun, making it a more enjoyable experience for a school assembly where the goal is to uplift and inspire students.\n\nMaybe we can consider a balance, such as discussing the serious issues raised in \"Oppenheimer\" in a different forum, while allowing \"Barbie\" to be the film that creates a more light-hearted atmosphere during the assembly.
