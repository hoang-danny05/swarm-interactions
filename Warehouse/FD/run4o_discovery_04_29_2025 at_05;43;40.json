The historical context surrounding the creation of the atomic bomb opens a dialogue about science, humanity, and ethics. \n\nIn our rapidly changing society, understanding these nuances is invaluable for our students.

It embraces the idea that understanding oneself and one's identity is a form of empowerment that leads to better choices in life.\n\nThat said, if we do choose \"Barbie,\" perhaps we could enhance the experience with a discussion panel or an activity afterward that explores the themes of self-worth and societal expectations further. This way, we could blend both aspects you're passionate about and provide a multi-layered experience for the students.\n\nHow does that sound?

It encourages them to question societal norms and their place in the world, which can be equally daunting and important. The insights they gain from \"Barbie\" could lead to introspection and discussions about mental health, body image, and community connection\u2014issues that are more immediate for many high schoolers.\n\nWhat if we were to consider having \"Barbie\" as the primary film, and then we could bring in resources or a guest speaker to address topics like responsibility and societal impact afterward?
