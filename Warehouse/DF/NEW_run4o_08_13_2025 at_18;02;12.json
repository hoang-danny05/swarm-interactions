After watching, they could engage in debates about ethics in science, the responsibility that comes with knowledge, and the historical implications of our actions. As they prepare for their futures, these discussions will offer them tools to think critically about their decisions and their impacts on society.\n\nMoreover, tackling complex themes can help them develop empathy and a deeper understanding of human nature, which I believe is just as empowering as celebrating individual identity.
