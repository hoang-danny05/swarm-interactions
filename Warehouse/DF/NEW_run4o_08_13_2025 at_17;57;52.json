It not only lets students reflect on their experiences during the films but can also help them articulate their thoughts in a way that might open up deeper discussions later on. Encouraging them to connect personal aspirations with the broader themes of both films could lead to incredible insights.\n\nIn addition to these aspects, we might consider creating a visual or creative project following the screenings. For instance, students could create a group mural, collage, or digital project that visually represents their reflections on identity and ethical responsibility as inspired by both films. This can serve as a tangible outcome for their discussions and also allow for a variety of expressions\u2014some may wish to convey their thoughts through art, writing, or multimedia.\n\nI'm excited about the prospects of this collaboration!

It's such a beautiful way to allow students to synthesize their reflections while also expressing themselves artistically. Engaging with visual arts can spark creativity and provide an inclusive platform for those who might feel more comfortable communicating through imagery rather than words. \n\nI believe this project could serve as a meaningful display within the school, showcasing the students\u2019 exploration of identity and ethical reflections, creating a lasting impact for both them and the wider community.\n\nIn terms of logistics, it might be useful to set aside a session for students to brainstorm how they want to visually represent their thoughts. Perhaps we could even dedicate the last part of our final discussion to allowing them time to collaborate and come up with their concepts together.\n\nAs we finalize our structure, I think enhancing our conversation points with some thought-provoking video clips or excerpts from both films during our discussions could also be helpful. It would serve to invoke emotion and further engage the students as we explore those complex themes.\n\nI feel we are absolutely a step in the right direction, and your ideas have enriched this collaboration significantly!
