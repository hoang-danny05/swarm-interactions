These are crucial topics for young people today, especially as they stand on the brink of adulthood. The visuals are vibrant, and it has a fantastic sense of humor that will resonate with them. Plus, it's a good opportunity to spark discussions on gender roles and societal expectations, which are always relevant. \n\n\"Oppenheimer,\" while undoubtedly a monumental film about a significant historical figure, may be a bit heavy for the mood we're aiming for with the seniors.

Moreover, \"Barbie\" uses humor and fantasy to address serious issues in a way that is engaging and accessible for them.
