It sparks conversation about ethics, decisions, and the weight of our actions, which are all relevant topics as they prepare for adult life.\n\nMy years in volunteer hospice work have shown me how important it is to appreciate life and understand the consequences of our actions. \"Oppenheimer\" could foster meaningful discussions that are invaluable at this stage in their lives.

Plus, girls and boys alike can find relatable aspects within its story. I genuinely believe that \"Barbie\" offers a much-needed balance of fun and meaningful messages that our students will remember fondly. \n\nI think it's essential to create a positive atmosphere for these seniors, bringing them together with a fresh and exciting film that sparks joy and laughter.
