The transition from high school to adulthood is already a weighty moment; perhaps we can give them a movie that celebrates their journey and encourages them to reflect on their identities and their own paths forward.\n\nUltimately, my hope is that we choose a film that resonates with a broader spectrum of students, allowing for joy and connection while still sparking meaningful conversations.
