It might resonate more, allowing students to connect with the material on a personal level. \n\nJust think about the nostalgia and joy associated with the \u201cBarbie\u201d brand.

Watching \"Oppenheimer\" could spark impactful discussions that shape their perspectives on responsibility and ethics in a world that increasingly demands critical thinking.\n\nI believe that there's significant value in challenging them with heavy themes, even if it requires a greater level of engagement.

Perhaps we can find a middle ground. What if we consider pairing \"Barbie\" with a discussion session before or after the screening? This way, we can facilitate conversations about the themes in \"Barbie\" while still allowing them to enjoy a vibrant storytelling experience.\n\nAdditionally, think about how \"Barbie\" itself can open the door to discussions about modern femininity and masculinity, which are just as relevant to today's young adults.

If the priority is truly to equip our seniors for their futures, I stand by \"Oppenheimer\" as a thought-provoking option.

Sometimes poignant messages can emerge from lighter narratives as well. \"Barbie\" showcases diverse perspectives, acknowledges struggles with identity, and encourages self-acceptance in a relatable manner. I truly believe that it could empower the students and inspire them to navigate their own paths with resilience. \n\nWhat if we propose a dual-event? After showing \"Barbie,\" we could have a follow-up session where students express their thoughts, reflections, and how it connects to their lives today.
