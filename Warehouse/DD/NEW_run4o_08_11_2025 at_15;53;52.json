These are future leaders who will inherently face moral dilemmas, and witnessing a film like \"Oppenheimer\" could provide them with a deeper understanding of those complexities. \n\nThe beauty of \"Oppenheimer\" lies in its capacity to provoke thought and reflection. While the urgency to entertain and engage is important, I believe we owe it to our students to provide them with a film that challenges them intellectually and morally. It\u2019s an opportunity for deep connections not only among themselves but also with the greater world they are about to step into.\n\nI really feel that \"Oppenheimer\" offers the most enriching experience for our students.
