Considering that these students are at a pivotal moment in their lives, I think they would greatly benefit from the film's messages. \n\nOn the other hand, while \"Oppenheimer\" is a remarkable film as well, I feel it might be a bit dense for this age group.

It could ignite conversations around ethics, history, and the impact of science on society, which are vital topics for them to explore at this juncture in their lives.\n\nPlus, experiencing a film that delves into such profound subject matter could be greatly enriching.

The film shows how individuals can embrace their uniqueness and challenges societal norms, which is an important lesson for this age group. \n\nIt encourages conversations about self-acceptance, feminism, and the idea that it\u2019s okay to challenge expectations\u2014all vital themes for young adults about to step into the real world.
