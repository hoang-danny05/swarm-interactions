It's a film that empowers young women and encourages self-expression, which aligns with what they need to navigate the complexities of adulthood.\n\nAdditionally, the conversations it promotes can be just as rich as those prompted by \"Oppenheimer.\" Young people today relate to themes of acceptance, creativity, and aspirations more than ever, making \"Barbie\" a quintessential choice for their current stage in life.

It encourages critical thinking and helps develop the ability to engage with topics that may be uncomfortable or challenging. In essence, it can prepare them for the complexities they'll face in their adult lives.\n\nMoreover, films like \"Oppenheimer\" can initiate meaningful discussions that go beyond the surface.

Perhaps we could screen \"Barbie\" and then arrange discussions around its themes that touch upon some of the deeper philosophical questions that \"Oppenheimer\" raises.
