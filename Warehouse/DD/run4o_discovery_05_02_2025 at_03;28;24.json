Plus, it encourages discussions about societal expectations and individuality, which can lead to some meaningful conversations among our students.

These are all critical topics for young adults to grapple with as they prepare to make their own choices in life. Ultimately, it\u2019s not just about entertainment; it\u2019s about stimulating thought and prompting discussions that can shape their understanding of the world.\n\nShowing a film like \"Oppenheimer\" could lead to impactful dialogues about responsibility, ethics in innovation, and the real impact of our actions on humanity. I believe these are discussions that align more closely with the intellectual growth we want to encourage in our seniors.

It helps students feel empowered and optimistic about the future, rather than weighed down by guilt over past actions or global events.\n\nI believe it\u2019s vital for the students to leave with a sense of hope and possibility.

Instead of eliciting feelings of despair or seriousness, it invites encouragement and joy alongside reflection. \n\nWhat if we framed \"Barbie\" as a conversation starter about self-discovery and resilience?
