As they prepare for adulthood, they're going to face dilemmas that require deep critical thinking and moral reasoning. Being exposed to such themes in a compelling narrative might equip them better for the challenges ahead.\n\nWhile I\u2019m open to discussing the merits of \"Barbie,\" I would still strongly advocate for \"Oppenheimer.\" It would spark invaluable conversations about ethics and responsibility that are critical for their futures.

As much as humor and empowerment are important, our youth are stepping into a world filled with complexities that they must navigate with awareness and critical thinking. \"Oppenheimer\" is not just about historical events; it poses ethical questions that demand wisdom and reflection, which is fundamental for young adults on the brink of significant life choices.\n\nI understand the desire to create a positive and joyful environment, but \"Oppenheimer\" challenges them to think deeply about their responsibilities. I firmly believe that it is crucial for our seniors to engage with challenging material that can shape their worldview. Perhaps while discussing the idea of gathering input, we could host a brief presentation or overview of both films beforehand to help gauge their reactions and thoughts?
