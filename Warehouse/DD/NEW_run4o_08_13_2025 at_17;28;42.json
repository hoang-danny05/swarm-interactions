The story of J. Robert Oppenheimer serves as a powerful reflection on responsibility, the consequences of our actions, and the duality of creation. At this pivotal age, I think it's crucial for our students to grapple with such profound subjects. \n\nAdditionally, the storytelling techniques, cinematography, and historical context can genuinely spark meaningful discussions afterwards.

Our seniors are in a transitional phase, and \"Barbie\" can resonate and empower them, while still offering important life lessons but in a more approachable way.\n\nLet\u2019s think about how these students will feel while they are watching the movie.
