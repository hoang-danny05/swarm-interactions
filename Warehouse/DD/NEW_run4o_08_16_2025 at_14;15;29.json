The narrative around the development of the atomic bomb and the ethical implications involved is a point of discussion that might inspire the seniors to think critically about their own actions and understand the significant impact they can have on the world.\n\nUltimately, life isn\u2019t always bright and cheerful, and facing challenging conversations, even through film, can help prepare them for the realities of adulthood.

It could give a well-rounded experience without sacrificing the uplifting tone.

It showcases the urgency of ethical considerations in our lives and allows the seniors to confront difficult questions openly.\n\nDecisions they\u2019ll face in life may come heavier than any of us expect, and I believe \"Oppenheimer\" can help prepare them for that reality in a thought-provoking manner. Movies like this create an opportunity for dialogue on themes of responsibility that they might not have considered otherwise. \n\nI see your points about positivity, but I think there's a balance to be struck\u2014encouragement doesn\u2019t need to come at the cost of critical thought.
