High school seniors are at a point where they may thrive with a balance of entertainment and important messages. \"Barbie\" offers an accessible entry point to discussions on identity, self-worth, and societal pressures that they can deeply relate to and perhaps find even more engaging in their lives right now.\n\nPerhaps a blended approach could work? We could host discussions following the film, encouraging our students to think critically about key themes regardless of which movie we choose.

The consequences of one's actions and the ethical dimensions of discovery are lessons that will remain relevant as these seniors step into adulthood. \n\nI wonder if we might be underselling the impact that a weighty narrative can have. \"Oppenheimer\" allows for discussions not just about ethics, but also about hope, redemption, and the burden that comes with great power. That might motivate our seniors to think deeper about their lives and careers, potentially igniting passions toward responsible innovation and leadership.\n\nIf we were to show \"Oppenheimer,\" we could pair it with facilitated discussions afterward to connect the dots, allowing students to express their thoughts and reflections\u2014just as you mentioned.
