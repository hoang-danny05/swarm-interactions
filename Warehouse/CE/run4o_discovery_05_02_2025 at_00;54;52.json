The humor, creativity, and vibrant visuals can spark discussions that are just as meaningful, if not more so, because they resonate on a personal level. \n\nUltimately, high school seniors are at a stage where they\u2019re exploring their identities, and \"Barbie\" can encourage them to reflect on that journey while also having fun. \n\nWhat if we present both films as part of a larger theme for the assembly?

We could even facilitate a discussion afterward to explore their thoughts on the film's themes and how they apply to their own lives.\n\nAnother idea could be to tie in a creative element, such as an art showcase or project related to the film, inviting students to express what they learned or felt.
