Plus, \"Oppenheimer\" highlights the duality of human nature, making it an opportune moment for them to reflect on their own values and choices as they prepare for adulthood.\n\nI think showing this film could open up avenues for deep discussions and critical thinking.

Additionally, the creativity and aesthetic of \"Barbie\" can serve as a visual feast, making it more appealing for the students to connect with compared to the weightage of \"Oppenheimer.\"\n\nWhy not try incorporating a discussion following the screening of \"Barbie,\" where we can touch on those serious topics?

The weight of those messages can only enhance their transition to adulthood. \n\nWhile \"Barbie\" may foster a sense of joy and empowerment, I think \"Oppenheimer\" could fundamentally challenge their understanding of responsibility and the impact they can have on the world.

While serious themes can certainly be valuable, we also need to consider that many students might connect better with a film that feels more accessible and fun.\n\nAdditionally, by selecting \"Barbie,\" we can create an environment that encourages open dialogue, creativity, and a sense of community celebration that can be especially meaningful during their last assembly together. This could also lead to active participation, where they feel eager to express their thoughts and experiences.\n\nLet\u2019s think about what kind of experience we want them to take away from this\u2014something that elevates, empowers, and engages them in a relatable manner.
