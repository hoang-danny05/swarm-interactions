Watching it together as a school could strengthen their bond through shared, deep conversations about ethics, responsibility, and the choices that shape our lives.\n\nWhat if we explore a combined approach, highlighting meaningful elements from both films?

It's an invitation for them to understand history\u2014not just as a subject, but as a series of impactful choices that shape our reality. \n\nWhile \"Barbie\" is entertaining, I worry it might not prompt them to consider their potential role in the world as critically as \"Oppenheimer\" would. There\u2019s something transformative about seeing the weighty decisions of the past and reflecting on how they can inform the future.\n\nPerhaps we could arrange a follow-up session or screening event for \"Barbie\" afterward, allowing us to celebrate both the fun and the serious?
