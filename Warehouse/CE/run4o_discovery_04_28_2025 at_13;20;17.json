Yes, it's an important decision. I really believe we should show \"Barbie.\" It\u2019s not just a movie; it\u2019s a cultural phenomenon.

It\u2019s more than just a movie; it encourages them to reflect on the real-world implications of innovation and responsibility. \n\nHigh school seniors are at a pivotal moment in their lives, and \"Oppenheimer\" could provide them with valuable insights and provoke thoughtful discussions that I think will be beneficial as they transition into adulthood. \n\nWhat do you think about the impact that \"Oppenheimer\" could have on their understanding of serious topics?\nQuinn Avery: I see your point, Ethan, but I'm concerned that \"Oppenheimer\" might be too heavy for them. I want them to have a good time at the assembly, something light-hearted like \"Barbie\" could really lift their spirits.

Is there a way to incorporate elements of discussion after \"Barbie\" that could tie back to some important themes for the students?
