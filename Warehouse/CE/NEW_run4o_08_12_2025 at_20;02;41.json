It encourages critical thinking, which is essential for young adults. \n\nThe film offers a gripping narrative, stunning performances, and historical significance that can ignite passion for history and debate among the students.

These moments of introspection can be immensely valuable for them as they explore their futures.\n\nI'm not dismissing the importance of positivity, but I believe the weight and gravity of \"Oppenheimer\" can lead to essential, thought-provoking discussions that may stick with them longer as they enter adulthood.

I\u2019m truly passionate about this film because it provides more than just a viewing experience; it offers invaluable life lessons that could guide them even after high school. \n\nWhat if we looked at how both films could contribute to their growth in different ways but leaned towards the more impactful message that \"Oppenheimer\" offers?
