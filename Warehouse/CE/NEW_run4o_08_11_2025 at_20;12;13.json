These themes are incredibly relevant as they prepare to enter the real world, where they'll face complex decisions that will shape their lives and the world around them.\n\nI'm all for inspiring the students, but I think \"Oppenheimer\" challenges them to think critically about big ideas, which can be just as important as laughter and inspiration.
