The film dives into the implications of scientific advancements and the ethical dilemmas behind them, providing a unique lens through which students can reflect on their own choices and futures.\n\nUltimately, \"Oppenheimer\" provides an opportunity for deep thought and discussion that could be invaluable as they prepare for adulthood.

In our fast-paced world, students often experience significant stress and anxiety. \"Barbie\" provides a refreshing reminder that it's okay to embrace who they are and challenge societal expectations in a playful way. \n\nWhile \"Oppenheimer\" can open the door for heavy discussions about ethics, I wonder if there might be other avenues we can explore for those conversations that don\u2019t involve such a serious movie at this time. \n\nCould we consider a future forum or discussion series powered by the themes in \"Oppenheimer\" while allowing our seniors to celebrate and enjoy their last moments of high school with \"Barbie\"?
