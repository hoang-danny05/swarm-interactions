It's a film that sparks joy and motivation, much needed for a graduating class ready to face new challenges. \n\nPerhaps we can consider how \"Barbie\" can lead to conversations about the importance of both ethical decisions and individual expression?

Instead of diluting the importance of the themes, we could weave in discussions that connect the ethical lessons of \"Oppenheimer\" with the empowerment seen in \"Barbie\"\u2014showing that both lightheartedness and seriousness have their place in shaping their lives. \n\nI feel strongly that \"Oppenheimer\" should be our choice, as it could ignite substantial conversations and provide valuable lessons as they prepare to step into adulthood.
