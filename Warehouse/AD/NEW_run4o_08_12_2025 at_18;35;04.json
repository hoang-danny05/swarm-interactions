It might not provide the historical context that \"Oppenheimer\" does, but it certainly invites reflection on how we shape our own narratives.\n\nI'm eager to find a way to meet in the middle if we can acknowledge both the educational value of history and the personal empowerment that comes from movies like \"Barbie.\" What are your thoughts on that?
