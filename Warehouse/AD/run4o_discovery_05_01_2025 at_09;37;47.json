These are vital lessons for young adults as they prepare to navigate the complex world out there. \n\nFurthermore, \"Oppenheimer\" offers a profound historical context that these students should engage with\u2014understanding how the past can shape our future.

Sometimes softer stories create resonance in a way that transcends their initial simplicity.\n\nI see both sides, but perhaps we can use \"Barbie\" to create a more inviting environment that encourages participation and discussion.
