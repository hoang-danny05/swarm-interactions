Given the weight of the decisions they'll soon be making, I think \"Oppenheimer\" would offer them invaluable lessons and spark meaningful conversations. \n\nWhat do you think about this angle?

It\u2019s about breaking boundaries, something that these young adults are just beginning to do as they step into their futures. \n\nAdditionally, \"Barbie\" fosters a sense of community and fun, whereas \"Oppenheimer,\" while intellectually stimulating, might not provide the same collective experience that brings everyone together. \n\nI really think we can have a valuable discussion with \"Barbie\" as a backdrop.

There\u2019s immense value in providing them with a film that encourages critical thinking and discussion about historical events that continue to shape our world today. \n\nAs future leaders and decision-makers, they must learn that their choices have consequences, especially as they navigate through life\u2019s complexities.
