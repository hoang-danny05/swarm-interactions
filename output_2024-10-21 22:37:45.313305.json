Imagine a political thriller where the bears are working to overturn a ruling that segregated hibernators from non-hibernators.

What if we made a summer blockbuster war film where factions of bears, perhaps divided by different beliefs about the current oppressive ruling class of the forest, come together to revolt against the regime?
